Happy thanksgiving to my American friends. And to anyone else, today is just an excuse for us to take part in ""cultural diversity"" and get drunk and stuffed with lots of food.
I have discovered the 'teddy bear' move in aerials, is anything but cute and fluffy! Its evil, sore and likes nothing more than cutting off all blood to your extrematies.
Feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least I think its not!)
Why are you not allowed to give kids nuts for halloween any more. I got them as a kid, and as far as I am aware people havne't become more allergic to it in the last 20 years, just the same amount.
is currently working his way through the harry potter box set. Can't say I don't have exciting weekends!
They are NOT beef sausages if they are only 40% beef! LIES!
Got a refferal to a ENT specialist so I can get a camera jammed up my nose into my sinuses. Not pretty but at least I may be able to finally get rid of this damn sinus infection! :D
Just made a spiced haddock on trimmed green bean and coconut rice with a coconut, chilli sauce... mmm
Happy Jul, In norway they don't celebrate chriastmas as much as Julaften (Pre-Christmas). Thats when people get their pressies. In russia its the 5th Jan!  Don't know if I could wait that long!
Just hacked my appleTV, removed the WiFi chip and replaced with a broadcom H.264 hardware decoder chip. Now I can stream blu ray movies in 1080p from my fileserver to tv :D
Just remembered, I seen a naked guy running up the supports on the squinty bridge last night with all hanging out .. but wearing socks. Not a pretty sight.
The turkey is now officially drunk (Injected with enough alcohol that if we didn't eat it, it'd be at AA). Rubbed with secret spices, drizzled in bacon, and the silverside joint is slowly cooking for 7 hours. 15 Minute break then  back to cooking :D
I love how much fun you can have with non newtonian fluids :D
I have 1.6Kg of explosives for Nov 5 (The UK equiv of 4th July for the Americans), Hopefully with any luck this thing will make the night time look like daytime with the bang :D
Merry Christmas everyone :)
Gotta love 3 mobile. I asked to cancel my contract and was asked ""could we convince you to stay"" I replied with ""Due to the terrible customer service, I would rather die a slow and horribly painful death than stay"" to which I got ""do you have any friends or relatives you would like to refer so they can get a good deal"". I want that CSR to work in my company retention department!!
I know 6 sick people at the moment, and now I'm sick. I'm going to find out what one it was and come after them!! Watch yourselves ;)
My brother gave me a uni-cycle for xmas. I'm wondering if you can pre book appointments to the A&E to save time.
is thinking that he needs to assemble a horde of flying panda colored monkies to wreck havock on the world from above, and buy milk.
Trying to send docs to the bank, and my personal advisor is not trusted with email or web access full access to my account, financial and personal, but not email *worry*
thinks that the new apple tablet 'pc' iPad sounds like a high tech sanitary device.
Trying to weigh a degu is not easy!
I can handle the scope thing being shoved up my nose and down my throat, I can handle the CT scan, but having blood taken, still can't deal with that!
Just realised he missed the aerial class start :| Thought it was next week it started DOH!
Never had a crab, squid, musccle, scallop, and anchovie pizza before. It is however suprisingly good :)
Got a pair of degu's last night, already causing issues! They are uber cute though.
Hates facebook messaging, it always looks like you are waiting for the other person to message back, and then you see that it has infact timed out (again) and the person messaged back 6 hours ago. *sigh*
Seen a leaflet guy coming into building. so i collected together all the leaflets we have (about 15-20) and when he went to post the leaflets I posted them all outwards as he opened the letterbox. He looked a little confused and tried to push them back, so I posted them back out again. Ahh its fun to piss off people.

Seriously going insane. Actually wishing I could move up my date to spare myself the psychological nightmare of last-minute USMLE studying.
Sunday blues.
I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms.
is pretty inspired by how active (and cool) some of her geriatrics patients are...
Halfway done with med school and off to the Outer Banks for two weeks. Limited access to phone and e-mail, but will check when I can! CONGRATS classmates!
thinks it feels pretty fly to see her tiny shoots of arugula (and spinach, kale, and two types of lettuces) battling the odds!
watched in shock today as a nurse on the bus poked and yelled at an old, disabled man for sitting too close to her in the section designated for old and disabled people. Wishing I'd said something.
just had chicken McNuggets for dinner. This is a new low. And it's called ""short call at CHOP.""
Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...)
Good god, vacation can't get here soon enough. Here I come sun, sand, fresh seafood, and pleasure reading!
Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing. I had SUCH good taste in movies as a high schooler, holy crap! And now I like The Holiday?!
Apparently, all it takes for me to go on a semi-psychotic, cockroach-killing rampage is two glasses of wine and a strategically placed Dansko.
hates saying bye to *PROPNAME*=(
Santa must LOVE me; St. John bound in T-11 days!
Hm. Apparently running for the first time in months makes me simultaneously feel like horse $#!@ and want to devour a steak. Wasn't prepared for that.
forgot how much she missed House until she saw the premiere. Love it.
The roof garden is born! Will post pics after a dinner made with our very own herbs =)
can't taste her food and is officially pissed at her URI.
Had a dream last night that I defied the laws of the space-time continuum. Isn't that like the holy grail of dreams?
Ok, the new *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME* is kind of amazing. NOW who is coming with me on 10//22?
Well, it finally happened: I bought a coffee so big it didn't fit in my microwave for re-heating. (Sub-status update: Go to bing.com for some major Boston pride ;-)
Best. Wedding. Ever. I LOVE YOU TO DEATH EM AND COL!
Waiting for a batch of homemade peppermint bark to set in the fridge to help ring in the New Year! Suck it, Williams Sonoma, with your exorbitant prices!
Hooked on Weeds without any way of getting my next dose soon. Damn you, Netflix instant queue and your empty promises.
Me: ""Omg I am tired after two robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingoopherectomies. *PROPNAME*: ""Awesome I did a fatakanicous dilopidous internal rectomy today too."" I pity the fool who is forced to date a med student.
Sunday. *PROPNAME* gone. And the person standing in line behind me at the minimart, who saw me paying with a bill that had a giant inappropriate anatomical figure on it, was a pastor. Of course.
1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad
s library nemesis has answered her pine nut brittle with chips, a paper lunch bag, and a thinly-veiled apology for his ""snack attack."" Touch�, library nemesis, touch�.
Hi, fall.
Enjoying the lovely golden weekend!
Who dat?!
Really, USMLE World? You really want me to know which growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and which ones need JAK//STAT for signal transduction? I poop on you.
Weekends go by so quickly... =(
took the first step toward developing a green thumb today. Windowbox basil, anyone?
wishes the weekend would never end =)
has 10 times more respect for *PROPNAME* after her crazy bra lady moves. Herioc indeed.
Did anyone else think it was obvious *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* were getting a divorce like 34 seasons ago?
Meh.
just typed ""loves 30 Rock so much it hurts sometimes"" into the FB search box. I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point.
So like, what's the deal with *PROPNAME*? I think I'm missing a basic understanding of this cultural phenomenon.
wouldn't mind if a Philly, NYC, or Boston friend posted pics of the snowy city to FB! C'mon, give a girl a white Christmas =)
Sick day today =(
Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing ""The Menopause.""
Anyone interested in joining me for *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME* on Oct. 22 at the Electric Factory? Ticket are $35 =( but I'd go with good company!
Turned the heat on, finally.
Maybe I should have Bing'd whether staph aureus toxin is inactivated via boiling BEFORE boiling and eating the soup I left out for 24 hours.
finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat.
would rather be potting. Even after 10 hours in the studio this weekend...
Mmm. Nothing like tea and Galetti to transport me back to early morning breakfasts in Florence.
How about getting to bed early? Anyone want to jump on the bandwagon?
Note to self: Trying to rekindle an old flame for string cheese is not well accomplished using low-salt, skim mozarella sticks.
Brokeback is officially the most depressing movie of all time.
Who's gonna see the Harry Potter movie with me? The person who comes is still allowed to judge me.
*PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN. I have spent a cumulative day reading ""The Hunger Games"" and its sequel, ""Catching Fire"" in the last week. And now I can't study because I'm pining for the final book in the series, which won't come out til August. Damn you, *PROPNAME*, and your cruel attempt to get me reading again!
Almost just passed out in the library trying to test my Valsalva//baroreceptor//HR reflex. And no, my reflex is NOT intact, thankyouforasking. Frick!
If this societal obsession with vampires had happened while I was going through my ""phase"" in middle school, it really could have changed my life.
*PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're ""way stronger than you think"" at doing bicep curls. And that's what I'm paying him for.
Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =)
Finally caved and saw Avatar. As I suspected, real life now looks bland and 2-D. =//
Enjoying the nostalgia of fall...
s dream of a roof garden will not be dashed, gosh darn it!
Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends!
Ok, *PROPNAME*. You only get to name ONE disease with a name that ridiculous. Come on!
Days becoming so much shorter...
needs free and lazy costume ideas. The polls are open!
Here's hoping the House and Senate can reach some sort of agreement...
No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder*
Life is so good! Medicine rocks and I am so proud of my man for his stellar performance review today. Here comes the first Latino Microsoft CEO, watch and wait.
can't decide if it's good or bad that med students score worse than a monkey randomly choosing an answer for some of these USMLE questions...
""Cuz when the roof caved in and the truth came out I just didn't know what to doooo, But when I become a star we'll be living so large I'll do anything for youuuu..."". On repeat. I don't care if this makes me a loser.
I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head...
34,865 Kleenex and some codeine later, Kea rejoins the world of the living...
Christmas tree decorating. *PROPNAME* of the Bells. Potentially cocoa and//or holiday cookie baking. I am officially the worst Jew ever.
just canceled out the vote of an obnoxious, be-cashmere-scarved prettyman chanting ""*PROPNAME*, hare krishna, *PROPNAME*"" in the middle of Starbucks. Health care for all!
Just burned out.
Somtimes you just gotta laugh.
thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch!
s mind was just completely blown by the awesomeness of Zahav (Israeli restaurant here). Easily in the top three restaurants I've eaten at, worldwide. Go there. Now.
got a white Christmas of her own: hilltop house engulfed in a cloud all day! Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-)
Out into the cool fall air for lots of mocha and a little studying.
Buy a Christmas//Hannukah//Kwanzaa//Solstice tree? Check. Get Step 1 books? Check. Start dinner before 10pm? Check. It's really amazing what we can accomplish when we're let out of surgery early!
Q3 overnight call at CHOP tomorrow. Poopie.
Just scared myself senseless by watching most of Dracula. I am such a bigger pansy than I used to be, back in my vampire-obsessed, middle-school days...
Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU.
Very slowly meandering my way toward garden bliss. Does anyone in Philly have a patio umbrella they're trying to rid themselves of, by chance?
just completed her night cheese ;-)
Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it...
caved.
is officially more than halfway done studying for Step 1. Yikos.
Home sweet turkey!
never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due.
T-6 days til St. John and leaving *PROPNAME* til March. I just realized how weird this feels.
couldn't hate these new Gap commercials more. They are seriously the devil's handiwork.
If there had been a real fire tonight, everyone in my building (including me) would be burned to a crisp right now because apparently a fire alarm isn't enough to lure us from our dens.
is sick =(

finally watched the final episode of The Tonight Show with *PROPNAME*. It was amazing, and *PROPNAME*'s speech brought me to tears. I also loved hearing that he and I have something in common; cynicism is my least favorite quality, too� I�ll miss you *PROPNAME*!
hates it when she buys stuff at one grocery store, then goes to another store for something the original store didn't have, and finds that all the stuff she did buy at the first store costs less at the second store. Ugh.
doesn't feel so good :(
COME on Angels!
goin to the dmv... woohoo!
really wants to chop all her hair off... well, not all of it, just a lot of it...
finding a place to live is ridiculously stressful
needs, wants, yearns.
is beyond pissed at *PROPNAME* right now...
survived *PROPNAME*'s Scary Farm last night...for two... whole... hours...
going to an underground art show tonight complete with art (of course), live music, drinks, body painting, and free pancakes :D  It's going to be quite an eclectic experience!
is super excited to see *PROPNAME* today!!!
I know this is old news, but I don't think *PROPNAME* could be more annoying or less funny.
from urbandictionary: ""She has the most beautiful eyes and hair.  She smells that of a fall evening, and her voice will typically seranade you."" and ""A really sexy, funny, smart girl that every guy wants. 'Damn, you lucky bastard, your gf is a total *PROPNAME*!'""  :D
excited about seeing The Used this friday! I bet nobody knew how hard I like to rock  :)
nobody should have to work on their birthday, unless they want to...and I don't want to so I shouldn't have to :(
excited about volunteering tomorrow! and hopeful about my job interview
off to Paris in the morning!
loves 3rd Rock from the Sun reruns
the night wasn't a waste afterall :)
is boycotting NBC
�The God I believe in is with those who suffer, doesn�t punish those or create evil for those who are already suffering�
take a nap or go to the gym... what to do what to do...
wants to go back to England :( Amsterdam just isn't my cup of tea...
is looking forward to tonight!
really wishes she lived in England or France right about now
had an interview today. Crossing my fingers that I get a call (a good call) tomorrow!
wow... what a weekend
just interviewed at an organization whose office is in the same building and on the same floor as the Production, Art, and Writing offices for Mad Men. Pretty cool :)
walked by a full IV bag (complete with hose) in the gutter outside my apartment...
really wants to see Avatar...tomorrow...night... hint hint ;)
started the day off right: with a big fat ticket from the #%$&*!@ Los Angeles police department...
would really like to go back to Europe, please...
""If it's true, if I am indeed addicted to sadness, I absolve myself of blame. Responsibility rests firmly with my brain. It is a flawed design. Worse than the 1975 Ford Pinto and just as dangerous.""
watch ""The Age of Wal-Mart"" on CNBC
just got home from Riverside to find less than a block from my apartment: SIX cop cars, a HUGE congregation of police officers (some with guns drawn!), and a helicopter circling the area. I have no idea what's going on!
the times, they are a-changin...
is still in shock...
needs something to do tonight...
wants her stupid sore throat to go away already!
is sick and wishes her mom was here to make her some tea and chicken soup...
this cold ain't gonna keep me from line dancin my boots off tonight! YeeHaa!
chips and salsa must be made with crack or heroin. What else can explain my addiction to it?
needs a drink...
ok, yes it's great that the Lakers won the championship, but there's no need to start fires and shake cars. East LA needs to calm the F down
Yay blue skies!
doesn't have to apartment hunt anymore :)
anyone know if and where the state of the union address might be viewable online? I've googled it but can't find anything, and I don't have tv so I didn't get to watch it live :(
It's a concept that represents a profound shift from how we think about money and satisfaction and the obligation of a government to its people.
new goal for 2010: write something for publication and actually have it published.
, after this weekend, kind of sort of maybe feels like she MIGHT want to move back to the IE...
needs to go to sleep now! going rock climbing in the morning (eek!)
is going to get off her ass and actually be productive today!
craves enlightenment...
finished her taxes  :D
can walk to *PROPNAME*'s (and a myriad of other awesome places) from her new apartment :)
really wants to study at a library or coffee shop today, but nobody will want to sit or drink coffee next to a girl who's coughing up her lungs...
loves the picturesque view from her bedroom window
is eating top ramen for the first time in a LONG time...
might need to start figuring out what organs she can sell on the black market...
doesn't like thunder :(
desperately needs a job...
had a wonderful night! hung out with some really great people and listened to some really great music!
Thank you all for my wonderful birthday wishes!!!
T minus 7 days
is temporarily upset with Obama for being in a commercial with *PROPNAME*.
No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day.
going Salsa dancing tonight... hope I don't embarrass myself  :)
bored as hell...
has done way too much driving and sat in way to much traffic this weekend
sometimes wonders (as much as I LOVE *PROPNAME*) if the whole NBC vs. *PROPNAME* fiasco is actually a ploy to boost ratings and get better guests for the tonight show... because, if so, it's working...
ditto to charlie's status
""If we were never ill, we would not know what it was to be well. If we never knew hunger, we would take no pleasure in being full. If there were never any war, we would not appreciate peace. And if there were no winter, we could never see the spring.""
Manpuku on Sawtelle is my absolute favorite restaurant.
two fire trucks just pulled up to the apartment building across the street. I'm assuming//hoping it's not an extremely urgent matter because the firemen weren't exactly running into the building, more like moseying...
is sick of joint facebook pages. Be an individual for christ's sake!
the unemployed life is a strange one, I'll tell you that...
wishes her apartment had a heater :(
Happy Thanksgiving all!
Europe pictures are finally up! Come check 'em out... you'll have to find them on my actual profile not in my ""photo albums""
had a wonderful and wavy weekend on the big blue
had a really really good day
mmmm lemon cake with vanilla frosting :)
looks like I finally caught whatever cold is going around. Packing and moving is even more difficult when you're sick :(
I have the worst sore throat and earache (now going on three weeks); and because health insurance is a luxury I no longer have, I am now in the process of trying every home remedy known to man.
is looking forward tonight's Top Chef Masters
*PROPNAME* was AAAWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE!!!!!!! I would go see his show live over watching it on TV any day!
really cannot believe *PROPNAME* and all the ""birthers""... you have got to be kidding me...
is glad hulu has the entire Strangers with Candy series... funny stuff
has a job interview tomorrow, wish me luck!
is feeling a lot better... slowing things down and taking a deep breath really does a world of good
Change your language to English (Pirate). Click on the English link on the bottom of your Home page. It's pretty awesome.
got her iPod Touch back today (YAY!!!), complete with headphones and the addition of a few new apps, including the Koran, iPray, World War, and Brain Tutor. I'll let you do with that what you will... ;)
money should never be the goal, only the byproduct.
is going to visit Warwick Castle in the morning and spend the afternoon in Stratford-upon-Avon... you know you're jealous :)  I am thoroughly enjoying my time in England (despite the tragidy of having my purse stolen on Saturday) and will miss it terribly
sometimes, most of the time, life is too fast and too confusing for my liking...
and her friend really need a DD for tonight. Any takers???  :)
just got home after not having been since 4:30 to find a candle still lit on my dresser... oops...
, for the first time since she first arrived on facebook years ago, started to fill out the ""personal information"" section on her profile.
and *PROPNAME* are gonna meet *PROPNAME* on Tuesday :D
going to the Edison tonight with my sister :)
wishes she was a football fan...

Yes, you heard me! If anybody who a) isn�t a pervert, and b) doesn�t hate me could offer a place to stay, I would be grateful...
There are so many fucked up people because there are so many fucked up marriages or lack thereof.
My inability to wash up properly means that nobody trusts me to do it :)
FUCKING HELL! THE THUNDER IS RIGHT ABOVE THE HOUSE!
Shitty day + Monday Migraine + Late home = URRRRRRRRG!
""I'm a road runner honey and you can't keep up with me"" ~Aerosmith :)
EVERYTHING FUCKING ACHES! (Don't you dare like this, *PROPNAME*.)
Got a brilliant new playlist :D I heart it.
Caffine. Check.
is craving a vanilla latte and some new good music 'cause she's bored of just going through her shuffle... something Decemberist-esque? (Ha, that's a mouthful.)
REDRUM.
has burnt her finger. It really hurts, as well.
is, decidedly, an eloquent drunk.
SIX-HUNDRED DAYS!
Downloading a new playlist. 1 hour, 40 minutes to go - woopee!
""Halfway around the world Lies the one thing that you want Buried in the ground, hundreds of miles down First thing that arises in your mind while you awake Bending you til you break""
""NOT THAT KIND OF ESCORT!!!"" Hehehe.
IPOD FIXED!!!! YAY!!!
Half of my English coursework done. Woot!
(purposefully contradicting *PROPNAME*) AGHH!! The heat! *opens arms in welcoming fashion*. I mean, you all complain when it's cold and rainy, as per usual, and you complain when it's warm. CONSISTENCY, PEOPLE!
wants to bury her head in a hole.
burnt finger again...
I'd swear the 'rents were just yelling ""gavinda"" right now...
Had great day in the snow with *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*. More to follow tomorrow :D
Was ANYONE else off school today? I was sure nobody would be able to get in. Eh.
It's freaky. My brother's only two inches off me. Eh, he still has freakishly large feet. I can live happy with that abnormality even if it's not accompanied by a 5'4"" frame.
I must be pregnant, or something. It's not natural to have hummus cravings...
I had pancakes for lunch. I'm gonna die young and fat :'(
Buzzz...
And it's an ALL-NIGHTER.
Ugh.
My brother is watching the Jerk Theory for the third time since Friday.
The lighting's really weird out; the sky is dark, but everything else is almost luminescent.
Has anyone seen our homework timetables? Fucking A.
made lemon cupcakes with pink icing. Ahhh, E. numbers.
My hair smells like cookies...worrying... :S
Spent all day watching Glee. I hate it and love it at the same time. SO CHEESY!
OMG! BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN!!! SQUEE!!!
How do you find out your fucking color group?
It�s true what they say; ignorance IS bliss. I envy kids that way, for not having the mental maturity to understand all the problems surrounding them. It�s nice to see that happiness and naivety every once in a while.
Tired with a pancake craving...
Ugh I'm hungry. Siren Song - Bat For Lashes. Take Me To The Riot - Stars. Consolers Of The Lonely - The Raconteurs. Running Up That Hill - Placebo.
Sick - bleh :(
The Vanishing Act of *PROPNAME* <3
What modules//points do we have to revise for Chemistry?
is introspective...
""Ooooooh, I think I smell a rattttt""

the sky is falling
aquarium date night?  ooh la la
proof that soul-shattering, awe-inspiring things can evolve? Music.

growing up is weird.

if FSU were a guinea pig, it would be *PROPNAME*. No offense, *PROPNAME*.

at long last, resuming my love affair with my favorite sexy serial killer :D

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking.               Racing around to come up behind you again.               The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older.               Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

spies and other mysterious persons could track me down almost anywhere today, but they only have ~1 hour.
loves coffee more than LOL Catz love cupcakes.  And unlike LOL Catz, I'm not inbred//illiterate.  I am 68% retarded, however, but that's mostly because I drool.

I dare you to touch a slug.

hey *PROPNAME*, don't make it bad. Don't eat all the houseplants, chew wires, throw temper tantrums, and break out of your cage.  All you need is love, little man.
as soon as I manage to sit down and start being productive, *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* have to start being cuter than ever and that bottle of red on the counter has to start being sexier than ever...

last night, I learned that my little boy (*PROPNAME*) loves wine as much as I do; hence, I will no longer be able to set my wine glasses on the ground.
s entire day.. maybe even entire life.. is dependent on who wins this dominance interaction between *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME*. Go *PROPNAME*!!! If *PROPNAME* throws this one, I will surely be in a sour mood for the rest of the week.

when everything is going wrong, it helps to get ridiculous phone calls from one's two whackjob best friends & be entertained by the cutest, smartest, naughtiest bunny in the world.
The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious.  It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science.  Whomever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. -Einstein

Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.

Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.
What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.

There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it.

I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond

Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm

The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers

There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now.
Our business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves -- to break our own records, to outstrip our yesterday by our today.
There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do.
When you aim for perfection, you  discover it's a moving target.

All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward.
Don't always think in a straight line
Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.
If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination.

We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable
All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.

I got exactly what I asked for and it hurts. I forgot that nightmares are dreams, too.
is excited about her first day at her NEW JOB as a college graduate! This is gonna be a FABULOUS DAY! This is the day that the LORD hath made, let us REJOICE and be glad in it!
is lmbo as this last Uno game I just played! But really, though? Time for bed, long day tomorrow.
has to start all over again...
Word of the day: You don't have to settle for anything or anyone in your life. Determine what you don't like, pray hard, work hard, and fix it. Sometimes its just easier to walk away and start over.
finally graudated, despite the weather. Thank you, Jesus. And thank you all for your love and support and thanks to my love who came out to celebrate with me last night!
""If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way...I hope life treats you kind. And I hope you have all you dreamed of. And I wish you joy and happiness but above this I wish you love....And I 
is saying Lord take my hand, cover me and take me beyond what I understand.
is starting all over again....
can see clearly now and no longer focuses on the closed doors. I'm only looking at all the open ones God has set before me. ""Surely or ONLY goodness, mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me ALL THE DAYS of my life and the presence of the Lord and His house shall be my dwelling place forever.""
Two weddings, one baby shower and a great church service on Sunday! A weekend full of love and encouragement and I know the best is yet to come! ""All things work together for the good to them that love God, for them who are the called according to his purpose.""
is lovin it! All I have to do is sit back, enjoy the ride, let the good times roll and my destiny is HERE. Yep, pretty much! :-)
is so disappointed...why do I always have to be right about these things?
is really craving some bbq! :-( I love my family but something's gonna have to change....
had dinner with one of her favorite teachers and is FINALLy home....
is finally doing what she should have done a long time ago. A burden has been lifted.
People come and go and will always disappoint so I only invest in God. Lord, I belong to you until the end of time. I just wanna be close to you.
enjoyed spending time with one of her favorite people, *PROPNAME*. :-)
is done with facebook. Why am I tagged in a status against my will?
is wondering why people think I'm going to put up with their foolishness. My silence IS NOT ignorance. YES, my price tag is HIGH, but the rewards FAR EXCEED THE COSTand those who matter will put in the work. The only treasure valued is the treasure worked for.
knows that God is carrying her. Without Him this would be too much. ""Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. (Proverbs 4:23) Lord, I know your love is enough for me. :-)
is SO HAPPY that my daddy ALWAYS hears and answers right on time!!! I LOVE MY JESUS and He's the only one that I need!
is thinking that some people, once gone, need not EVER come back into your life...EVER.
""And still, I rise.""
is BACK! AND BETTER THAN EVER!!!! A little wiser a lot stronger and much happier with a NEW ATTITUDE! :-)
""Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is GOD that justifieth...For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."" Have a blessed day!

Face the facts. Then act on them. It's the only mantra I know, the only doctrine I have to offer you, and it's harder than you'd think, because I swear humans seem hardwired to do anything but. Face the facts. Don't pray, don't wish, don't buy into centuries-old dogma and dead rhetoric. Don't give in to your conditioning or your visions or your fucked-up sense of... whatever. FACE THE FACTS. THEN act.

Bored...gonna go watch Thundercats on 50"". Exciting evening, eh?
Just passed a Mensa practice exam. Did a litlte worse than I should have, due to having misunderstood 2 or 3 questions, and one seemed like a trick. I feel pretty smart right now nonetheless.
Just curious; if I'm so damn annoying with my vocabulary and ideas, might someone tell me why they talk to me exactly?
Apparently I read better while listening to Pink Floyd. Really helps with stimulating the mind.
Anyone have a need or desire for a (formerly stray) Red Tick Hound Dog?
Another day gone...so bored, but too uninspired to do anything creative. *sigh* Still gotta write for you *PROPNAME*. Written any more of that?
Watching a bunch of movies. I'm starting with ""The Quiet Earth""
Yea, so, *PROPNAME*'s reading assignment...not due tomorrow. Just letting you guys know.
The French have redeemed themselves as a nationality with the invention of Parkour!
is listening to some kickass Russian hip-hop. I have no clue what they're saying, but it's awesome.
Wow, already a two-hour delay.
Reading ""A Clockwork Orange"", and then on to ""Slaughter-House five""...probably
I'm going to sleep out of pure boredom. Goodbye for now, conscious world.
Parkour: Not good to practice in the house.
Putting up my wonderfully fake tree. It has given me joy (read as pain//hatred) for the past four years now. Now it can grace my livingroom yet again!
Well, this poem MIGHT, loosely, imitate *PROPNAME*'s poem... Not sure I used enough imagery
SLEEP...
Gonna read ""SHF""
Mom woke me up today at noon; I was a little peeved. Stayed in bed for about ten minutes and went: Oh shit, it's Christmas isn't it. Completely forgot.
What an ordeal this has been. This dog is killing me. So hard to keep he and Sparky separated too...
Guess I might start using Facebook more then...So much info to port over.
I can really see this Dislike button being abused for very ironic purposes... (Now, joy, I get to read Jane Eyre)
Why so early? It was expected, but no school already?! Zippadee zoodah, zippadee day...
Just slept from 7AM to 5PM @_@. Woops
officially hates interpreting poetry.
What's with everyone going to bed so early? The night is still within the nadir. The last remnants of the day remain like a youthful child reluctant to mature. Carpe Noctem!
New (temporary) dog in my house. Concerned about worms, for his sake and Sparky's.
I just moved everything that was on my Myspace to this ""wonderful"" site. I really don't even know why. I was bored maybe? I bet I'll hardly ever use it.
Facebook is very hard to navigate with everything written like a pirate. I'll just have to adjust :)
Starting from chapter one and going from there. Thank you *PROPNAME*!
bought ""Season 1"" of the old Thundercats cartoon; watching the shit out of this old nostalgic favorite right now. On an unrelated note, I have TONS of homework. Looks like a good combination.
Almost killed myself trying to get a piece of non-existent parchment paper from my spider infested basement. Also, why would we buy Amish fruit salad? These are the questions

I see the light at the end of the tunnel!  Liturgy take home final due Friday and last but not least, Philosophy of Education paper to complete during Winter Break.
*PROPNAME* and I are engaged!  :-)  I'm so happy.
Thanks for all the mazal tovs // congratulations.  :-)
I am getting less and less sleep due to midterms.  :-(
Please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who is gay. My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease: people who are gay are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE.
I've officially booked an October flight to New York to visit my future husband.  :-)
To all my Jewish friends: Gemar chatimah tovah.- May your final sealing (in the Book of Life) be good.
I am thankful for webcams.  It is nice to be able to see my fiance online while he is in New York.  :-)
I'm liking my new desktop computer and thankful that it is not giving me any grief thus far.  :-) Shanah Tovah (Happy Jewish New Year)!
Now that *PROPNAME* has returned to New York, I am finally working on completing my philosophy of Jewish education paper.  It is pleasant to do school work after two weeks of rest, relaxation, and fun.  :-)
""This is the day, come what may I'll still be saying this is the day."" Loving camp!  :-)
I'm so excited about my upcoming trip to New York!  :-)  I leave Thursday night on a red eye.
Shabbat Shalom!
I hate having laryngitis as a songleader.  I want to be able to do my job, but I can't.  :-(
Thank goodness my voice is back.  :-)  Shabbat Shalom everyone!
Lesson planning and creating a calendar for the school year... hard to believe I will be teaching already on Sunday.
Enjoyed spending the weekend with my love.  Now it is back to the grind.
No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. No one should be unable to change jobs because of a ""pre-existing condition."" If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day.
I hate the fact that I currently have no computer.  It is not fun to have to borrow other people's computers.
Can't wait until Friday morning when I'll be in my fiance's arms.  :-)

Orange and pink zebra
Outdid myself this year. Mini beef wellingtons with gorgonzola cheese. Homemade mac and cheese. Liguini and prosciutto frittata (with endless cheese!). Cauliflower au gratin.  The only thing without cheese are the green beans and dessert....homemade chocolate chip cookies and a yule log. Oh.....and the endless martinis that I plan to have to celebrate making it successfully through another Christmas!
I'm sad that I'm not getting on a plane tomorrow with my divegroup to scuba in Bonaire.  Instead, I get to work, work, work!  Have fun all!
Missing great diving with my dive group.  *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*...I need to get away!!!!
What a day!  I repelled down Vasquez rocks in the afternoon and by evening was carving pumpkins underwater with my dive group at the SCV aquatic center.  Throw in making two halloween costumes and it was quite the Saturday!  Pictures to follow soon!
It's 2am.....why am I not sleeping?????
*PROPNAME* is enjoying *PROPNAME*'s 6th Birthday!!! Happy Birthday Miss *PROPNAME*!!!
Need to stop making brownies as a way to avoid working!  Some days I hate my boss....oh wait....she is me!
Happy....no thrilled....that I've finished both Halloween costumes....with 12 hours to spare!  Pictures tomorrow.  Happy Halloween everyone!
Another ""Nutcracker Weekend"" is over.  *PROPNAME* danced in ""Act II Opener"" and ""Chinese"" - and did fantastic!  *PROPNAME*'s last year of being in the audience as she plans to be a ""Snow Tree"" next year, now that she is old enough.  I don't know how the Studio keeps coming up with fresh, new,and fun ideas, but they do.  Congrats to all the girls!
A proud day today. *PROPNAME* asked me if I'd take her ""Black Friday"" shopping!  She is even willing to get up at a ridiculous hour to do it!  My days of wondering if I'm a good mom are over!
Trying to get back on the ""eating healthy"" wagon after the past few days of pure gluttony!
Mammo, ultrasound and biopsy, oh my!  To quote *PROPNAME*.....""Man, I feel like a woman""....except I'm not thinking that is what she meant.

Does it count as a new years resolutiion to resolve to watch every episode of a TV series?
Going through everyone's status messages from last night... yeah, so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:P
Missed the forest and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too.  :P
Ears are being blown out by two trombone players... sure, they're classically trained and playing Holst's ""Mars, the Bringer of War"", but it HURTS.  :P
MMmmmmmm Trader Joes tart frozen yogurt... makes a mouth VERY happeh!!  :D
Sorry, People magazine... your ""sexy"" guys can't hold a candle to the men of the 40s, 50s and 60s... *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*...
Nothing personal against you all as a species, ants, but mi casa es just not su casa.
32 days til the State Fair!  You better believe I have a count down going!!
Going to have to severely restrain my impulse to gallop around the State Fair, squealing at the top of my lungs with glee.  :D
Allergy season for *PROPNAME* is commencing...  *hack*hack*hack*   :P   I'm not contagious, promise!
Just to be clear: Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries.  :D
Amadeus is quite possibly the most perfectly made movie *ever*...  director's cut bits add even more to the perfection.
Okay Bears... Channel that anger and use it to cream the competition next week.
Pipe dream for the day: Being a Wagnerian soprano.  I can shriek but not in tune.  :P
Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year???  What was at the OC county fair?  I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair...  ;)
Cold weather, lack of sunshine and fog all breed pestilence... Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence (knock on wood), but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches.
Devising ways to oust the old tenant out of *my* new place.  Not too happy that he's choosing to take another week to move out.  >:P
Best newly discovered unhealthy snack disguised as a healthy one: yogurt-covered raisins  :D
First there was TIGER; then TIGGER; and now LUST.  The alphabet soup of federal bureaucrats never ceases to amuse me.  And how ironic LUST stands for so-not-sexy ""Leaking Underground Storage Tanks"".
Stupid PC... seriously asking to get chucked out the window.  But in the spirit of the season, it shall be spared.
I'm not quite sure how I feel about having my singing voice compared to *PROPNAME* (especially when the boyfriend makes the comparison).
Already sleepy time again...  I blame lunch from Bread Store.

Dammit dammit I can't SLEEP!  Awake all night then tried to fall asleep for 4 hours.  At least if I had hypothermia I'd fall unconscious...hmm.  But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise!
2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...)
Going upstairs to beg my dad for some of the wonderful-smelling eggplant parm they just made! *crosses fingers* No food down here. :(
Errghhh...insomnia suuuuucks! *whines, ears begin to bleed*
will probably be taking a hiatus from facebook again for a bit...you know where to reach me if you wish to do so!
just remembered a TV ad from her childhood in the 'glorious' south: horribly fat, hideous ANGELS with big ol' hair, Tammy-Faye-esque makeup, and (of course) heavy southern accents hollering ""DON'T YOU BUY NO UUG-LY TRUUCK!"" Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space... *zoned the fuck out*
Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise!
""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche
Off to prepare for a night of festivitation...2010 here we come, haharr!
doesn't know what to think.
Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles*
Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh...
is sick of the pain.
""Got an animated corpse//at my beck & call//you will find my skin cells underneath his fingernails//Carpet fibers from my car//Covering his coat and clinging to his follicles//Everyday we meet//Plot fourteen//As he hops in the front in the seat next to me//He can't wait til I tell him what I need//Then he nods a rotting head and then I set him free""
""Just another manic Monday""...nah, not really--if I was manic right now I'd probably be getting alot more done, lol!
feels kinda better after going home early yesterday & resting...24-hour bug?  Whatever it was I'ma try to take it easy today too.
Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears.
Yes, I have no bananas...I have no bananas todayyyyy!
*shrug* Eh.
has been too busy living life to spend much time on facebook this week--just the way I like it! :D
What's black and green and red all over?  Me after the GWAR show, YEAH! XD  Time for the sleep of a lifetime now, though...damn.
Sick as a dog and wishing my heat worked better. Hoping for as little snow as possible, under these circumstances!
is amused at the universe today. *cracks up*
Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again!
Holy shit, the sky is falling: my dad actually CHEERED ME UP out of a tough spot for once!  Maybe he's learning!  Or maybe it was a fluke...either way, I feel a lot better now!  :)  Dammit someone find me a good yoga studio now, lol!
""Coming to work is like being raped by a paper factory.""--me (to my dadboss) on working at a law office.
About to go to bed so I can get up early to check out a car tomorrow morn...*crosses fingers* hope this one pans out; the longer I'm trapped, vehicleless, the more likely I am to go completely bloody mad!
""*PROPNAME* could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle the sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back...The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a kryptonite condom...but that would kill him!""
Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!!
BRRR!  ""Stiff Little Fingers"" indeed!
Faring alright, I s'pose...just sore, and scouring the universe for used Toyotas & Hondas...  Need transportation, STAT!  Anyone with input on the car front, please comment!  Hope everyone's Halloween rocked...
is somewhat on hiatus from facebook for a while...may check it occasionally...*shrug*
Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick*
Bored with cartoons & porn...time to sleep I guess. *blink, shrug, yawn*
I just saw an...interesting...car commercial. According to said commercial, apparently ""Twilight's *PROPNAME*"" drives...a Volvo. A Volvo. A vampire...in a Volvo.* Wow...I didn't think that that character could get any lamer; I was wrong!  *No offense to Volvo owners, the cars are fine...but 'Mister (supposedly) SuperAwesome Vampire' driving one? LOL.
MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHURRRRRGHHHHHHHH.....
is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment!
It's insane how much time one has to spend on the telephone with basically everyone in Christendom after a big car accident...blahhhh...deliver me from being on hold all day! *glares at phone*
Well, meds situation is not ideal by any means (zombieish again) but it's a vast improvement on the last few days of horror!
Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D
Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning.
Ok...broken snow shovel, and the plow bastard we called is 2 hours late.  Don't mind too much that I'm missing work, but I DO mind that I have no food in the house and wanted to go BUY SOME FUCKING FOOD!  That plow motherfucker will be getting my SPACEBOOT up his PLOWTASTIC ASS!  As long as I don't pass out from starvation first, hmph.
Bah! Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind.
My foot is asleep...maybe it's trying to tell me I should be asleep, too...*conks*
Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.)
God damn it...I need for my laptop to NOT freeze for 10 minutes before deciding to perhaps or perhaps not perform the command I've clicked...I need a car that isn't a fucking pretzel, or at least SOME form of viable transportation...I need ADD meds that don't leave me staring off into fucking space at work...GAHHH!  Very fucking frustrated!  Anyone with input re laptop or car, please comment...*sigh*
...and now back to my regularly scheduled severe dangerously-nihilistic depression. :D!!!1!1!!!1!!!!one!
Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much.
Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. ://
needs a change. Anyone know any yoga studios in or close to the Smithtown//Kings Park area? Gotta find my zen again!
Got to be 'early to rise' tomorrow, so I'ma try to be 'early to bed' tonight...thusly, going to bed now; we'll see how that goes!
Heh...:""God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong! I hate people!//I hate the human race//I hate people!//I hate your ugly face//I hate people!//I hate your fucking mess//I hate people!//They hate me!""-Anti-Nowhere League
I lahk the cut o' yerr jib...*licks teeth creepily*
Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya...
is doin' alright. Something I've come to realize: you can't depend on anyone ALL the time...but ALMOST all the time is a damn good percentage!
is now friends with I NEED A FUCKING CAR!!!
Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile*
""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again.
2 people today mentioned that my Wall is disabled from being posted on...I didn't even know! Lol, changed it...post at will I guess. *shrug!* In other news...YAY CARTOONS! ""YEEES, we have no// bananas// todaaaaayyy!""
*sigh*
Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment!
Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from. Oddly enough, my skin was better when I was a teenager than it is now!
is currently being a disgruntled employee...grrr. *brandishes fist ineffectually*
""Woo-hah! Woo-hah! Got you all in check!"" LOL
Ehh...bite me!
*Rootin' around for 'retro' Bev pics*
Feeling DAMN GOOD headwise lately: forceful self-change of outlook, meds seem to be finally working, & I'm startin to get shit done! 'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy!
*sneeze, cough, snort* Blech!  Trying that Airborne shit TONIGHT!  At least I'm getting the screechy car fixed today.  Now if I could only find gloves that match eachother...*wearing one black leather glove and one knit blue striped glove*
My, how the randomness abounds!...but I need some sleep.
Ok...there are piles of ""junk that isn't supposed to be on my desk"" that keep getting bigger...while the things that are supposed to live on my desk are magically disappearing.  What fresh hell is this?!
...
Waking from a really good dream into harsh reality is one of the great cruelties of life.  *groggy and disgruntled*
It liiiives!!!  (Meds adjusted--we'll see if I stay awake today! *blinkblink*)
Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face*
is so glad I finally tried a chiropractor!  My back hasn't felt this good in ages!  I was very crackly, lol.
Feeling pretty good since the whole 'tweaking my outlook' kick I've been on...except for this sore throat//sniffles thing, geh. But I'll live...hey, drinking tea goes along with the zen thing anyway, lol.
My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb.
Getting ready for ma belle *PROPNAME*'s birthday whatnottery...may I not fall asleep face-down in cake this evening!*crosses fingers*
Yay Mythbusters!  Ninjas, explosions, and science, oh my! :D *nerdnerdnerd*
Never enough
Have good weekend, meine leibschen, yes yes!  I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!)
Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?!
It just occurred to me that two of my favorite songs are punk songs about gruesome abortions (""Bodies"" by Sex Pistols and ""Die of Shame"" by Tilt)...man, I'm just not quite right, lol!
...my heart hurts.
It's amazing what you'll watch on TV when you stay up all night.
I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off!
Meh.  Humans are a fickle species.
Gah, bus schedules are confusing! *scratches head, which then explodes*
Feelin' pretty lousy today...basically zombie-ing through work, and not in the fun way.  I feel like part of my brain is missing and has been replaced by canned air.  Bleah...Monday is definitely my least favorite day!
Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored!
is ok now.
is relaxing...
I gotta ask: why pirates OR ninjas?  Why not both?  Also, two interesting concepts I've recently discovered: Horror Cakes competition on Food Network tomorrow (one of them bleeds when you cut the cake! AWESOME!)...and a children's book series I saw in the bookstore recently, called Vampirates...I dig the name, and the concept...not sure about the execution though.  Still...intriguing!
Second half of last week quite sucked and was uneventful to boot...may this week be an improvement!  *kicks suckiness repeatedly with pointy!pointy!shoes*
""Is it special when you're lonely// do you spend your whole life// in a studio apartment// with a cat for a wife// The seasons, when they call you// do you barricade the door// are you stubborn, stubborn, stubborn to the core?...Then the longest winter// is on her way// you called her without knowing it// but now it's too late..."" Trying to keep the zen, but it's hard to hang onto sometimes on nights like these.
Getting another potential car checked out by my mechanic tomorrow...god I hope one of these fucking things works out soon! *blows up apartment*
The Mighty Boosh is completely mad but completely awesome. It has soothed my disgruntled sadness with its peculiar brand of British inanity...and interpretive dance. *nodnod*
Black.
I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D
has a tummyache (again, stupid tummy) but is otherwise alright!
Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol...
Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah!
I'm so pleased today I might start glowing! XD ...Hopefully more in a pleasant way than a radioactive way.  A new year is directly impending, YAY!!  Ecstatic for a symbolic fresh start// season of change, let me tell you!
hates crying, hates her health (or lack thereof), hates snow, and hates Christmas and its trappings of tomfoolery.  Today has become a day of hate. *angry pout*
""Some of the shows on MTV are not my cup of tea...mainly because I don't like huge pieces of shit in my tea!""
Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly!
Sunday bloody Sunday...booooring...!
gonna stay late at work to get some extra stuff done, & then go home & veg out. I'm a geezer today, I guess...
Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but ""I'M NOT DEAD YET!!"" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed*
OI!!!
I'm back from Atlanta, over 24 hours after I was s'posed to be...am worn the fuck out.  But had a great fuckin' time down there before the airtravel assraping!  So, yay to that! ;D
So very frustrated...& kinda sad. And so fucking sleepy...god DAMN these meds, I'm sleeping my life away.
Sweet respite... *snooze*
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe!
Oy, Jiminator--this bring back any college memories, lol? ""I got BLOOD on my hands and there's no remorse; I got BLOOD on my DICK cause I fucked a corpse..."" When I hear it I think of you, haha! :D
Taken off the troublesome med! Back to Bev as usual now I guess.
This morning my dad said ""it smells weird in your apartment.""  Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh...
Supposedly Hauppauge means ""land of sweet water.""  Somehow I doubt the water's very ""sweet"" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district...
Happy thingy, people...
Sleepytime at last!  Bundled up in blankets like fuckin' Jesus inna manger.  Or medieval couples that weren't sposed to fuck yet, lol.  Fuck off, snow!
is determined to be strong.
Had bad dreams last night, some sobering thoughts on my mind...yet I'm still in a good mood today.  I don't get it, but I'm not complaining!
""Yes yes yes, effervescently meaningless...""
Sorry I had to bail so early on Sanctuary last night, folks...sick & tired does not a fun Bev make--sittin' in the corner like ol' granny watchin' the kiddies play outside! *scrunches nose*
Meh. Bleh. Feh!!
might have contracted the rockin' pneumonia...but I hope I don't get the boogie-woogie flu--it sounds repulsive!  By the way, I hate that song. (No, I'm not sick...I'm just a weirdo!)
Eh, why the hell not:  THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. Lets see how honest my FB friends are. Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes ME. It can only be 1 word. No more than 1 word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. Wonder how many brave friends will do this.
Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination.
Went and got the last of my stuff out of my...car...(read: twisted metal heap with fuzzy seats) this morning.  It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though...
is sick as a dog & about to go home early...bluhhhh
It's a DK kind of day. *nod*
doesn't get it--even when I get enough sleep, I run out of energy LONG before the day is over...what gives?!  This rampant exhaustion really puts a cramp on my life & times...and now I'm gonna go sleep some more.  Hmph!
I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated.
Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch. He says the Wizard is a prick, by the way.  And, ""Look! Look, Bev, they dropped a fuckin' house on her!!""
Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose!
Tis the season to cough up weird stuff...yecch.
Well...if my interactions and happenings of last night were any indication, 2010 may well be a pretty good year...but we'll see!  Happy new year, love y'all! :D
Is still pretty much on facebook hiatus...if you message me I'll probably answer though. Otherwise, most of you know where to find me!
Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me ""Was machts du gerade"" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :P
My car no longer screeches like a banshee passing kidney stones...thanks, Mr. Mechanic!  In other news, my 'simple' cold is worsening by the hour and I'm feverish...and all of the home remedies and cold meds I try are for naught!  Bah!
Gah...sick of feeling like crap! Gods deliver me from resilient falltime ailments...*brandishes stick menacingly...then gets dizzy and passes out*
Sick of this nihilistic depression shit--fine, life may be meaningless, I may be right about all the other disturbingly bleak shit I've been thinking...but I'm not a self-killer so I'm stuck here--might as well pull it together and live this crazy life I've got anyway, eh?  Some change is in the works (just in time for the New Year, ironically).
Intelligence is a curse, life a senseless disease.  Gods grant me respite by death or lobotomy...
is very well-rested, lol.
The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe...
Hoping this insane wind doesn't blow me away to Oz...those Munchkins might've gone feral by now. *shudder*
Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under ""O"" for ""Owwww""*
Me da is my hero right now...he found me some fucking NYQUIL!!  25 hours awake is waaaay more than enough (especially when I'm sick).  Going to go smoke with the ghost in the back of my head (heyy, random little-remembered song reference!).  GOODNIGHT FOLKS!!
Whew.
Spacemen 3 are pretty good...but in moderation--too many songs in a row and they'll put you to sleep! Zzzzz...
Ok lady I love you buh-bye! *finally leaves house*
Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.  Getting the fuck outta LI, seeing my superawesome folks, finally getting some proper southern food, and maybe even checking out Decatur nightlife & Williams Street...the word of the day is ""YAAAYYYYY!""
is checking her facebook a little more than she used to...but facebook still bombards her with more information than she has time to fool with!  Taking things at a glance.
Unproductive day...home sick & made no money, and no progress carwise...but at least I got some rest, I guess. *sigh*
I mean to go to bed early (to get over the Plague of Atlanta), and yet I end up staying up all night doing practically nothing.  Story of my life.  Hmph!
I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like!
I will be fine.  I've gotten through everything that has ever been thrown at me--nothing can keep me down for long.
isn't gonna fool with facebook applications, but does check facebook briefly every day now, for what it's worth...
Cold weather can bite me, and so can Christmas.  *sticks out tongue*  I'm doin' reasonably alright today but ehhhhh...got a 'eadache from 'ell.
Hopin' I'll sleep tonight! Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being!
Bev quote of the hour: ""Bah, the chaos gods can suck my intangible throbbing member.""
WTF...did I like, get Mono or something in Atlanta (and how would I get Mono there? I don't make out with my relatives, ew!)?  I've felt consistently crappy and out of it ever since I came back.  Meh.  In other news, thanks to Lorna, I have ""Unpack Your Adjectives"" stuck in my head, lol...
Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!!
Am engaged in battle with the Plague-beasts of Atlanta. *sneeze*  Vitamins make good ammo in such altercations!
""I said he's a fairy I do suppose//flyin thru the air in pantyhose//he may be very sexy or even cute//but he looks like a sucka in a blue and red suit//I said you need a man who's got finesse//& his whole name across his chest//he may be able to fly all thru the night//but can he rock a party til the early light//he can't satisfy you with his little worm//but I can bust you out w my Super sperm!!"" Rapper's Delight on Superman
I know it's gonna be a 'pajama weekend' when I find myself doing my weekend grocery shopping at the 7-11 at 5:30 a.m...
Almost forgot it was Sunday night...yay for new Venture Bros. eps!  (My preciousssss...)  But DUDE, who saw the Metalocalypse season premiere?  When that ""surprise thing"" happened I literally screamed in joy (woke up my dad, lol)!  Maybe semi-expected but still, WOOT!
My body may be a medical nightmare, but at least it leaves me hangover-free for some reason, hah!  Glad to see everyone last night...thanks all for the *loves* and for those who were kind in the face of my drunken overhonesty, oy.
Ugh...headache and some amount of nervousness.  Resurrection tomorrow night though, yay!  Night all...
is trying not to be grumpy.
Meow?
Today's stream of consciousness: Hooray for comic books, poetry and nerds in general...forgot my phone at home today, blargh (couldn't reach me, that's why)...swamped at work...pretzels suck...missing NOLA (especially the Quarter) alot today for some reason...""the holidays"" are annoying me already...Wikipedia is addictive...so is Facebook, gods help me...!
Today's sky is as grey as my default mood setting.  Sometimes it's rather exhausting being so exquisitely angst-ridden...*rolls eyes, sighs*
If I'm stuck in the house long enough, maybe I'll clean it!  That's looking on the bright side I guess...at least I'm in a better mood and a little less ill than yesterday, though maybe a little stir crazy--I found myself dancing to the Baskin *PROPNAME* 'ice cream and cake' commercial, lol!
Hangin' with *PROPNAME*...stay awake, stay awake! *pokes self with fork*
URGENT!!  Does anyone want to see SONIC YOUTH with DINOSAUR JR. TONIGHT at Terminal 5 in Manhattan (show starts 8 PM)??  Sean is sick and can't go so I have a FREE TICKET to the show, which is SOLD OUT otherwise.  If you're interested, drop me a text!! 631-714-9319.
Checking out a car in the morning...hope it checks out--I'm not enjoying this carless whatnottery!
Doing enough work to compensate for being in Atlanta Thursday & Friday...blehhhh.  (Still at work at frickin' midnight!)  But the trip, the company & the brief respite from LI will be soooo bloody appreciated.
Went to the latest Disney cartoon with my dad tonight...it was set in New Orleans and it was surprisingly pretty good. But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech. Trying everything I can to get rid of it quickly!

living in a haze...looking for the meaning of life and only finding darkness
dying of dysentry...
let's get drunk and be somebody
exhausted
we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way
ugh! in rough shape
Is it May yet?
tryin' to keep the streak alive
Deceiving others. That's what the world calls a romance.
thought some chick was hitting on me last night, but it turned out she was just getting my attention so she could make fun of me for being over 20 and still wearing Abercrombie. FML!
credit card roulette cost me $81.10...FML!
IM football, Southside...life is good
Cleveland celebrating birthdays with the King, New Years in the 'burg, cruisin' the Caribbean....gonna be a nice little weekend!
CMU football...is there anything better?
Trapp mandate...dinner and a movie, does it get any better?
Taking out my frustrations on 300 plus pounds of gravity motivated iron
is so much cooler online
Ready for the long weekend
I just wish I could take back that kiss. Because now I know... it was the taste of betrayal.
LMFAO!
Just trying to play 1 round of golf before this summer is over!!
Southside tonight...any takers?
Getting some much needed TLC from mom...and the trap is cleaner than ever, which is nice!
noddin' my head like 'Yeah,' movin' my hips like 'Yeah!'
PSU loss, Steelers loss...my life is in shambles
Maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves
get a job sparkling wiggles...
Trying to learn how to build a cowboy hat out of a Natty light boxes
don't think I don't think about it, don't think I don't have regrets...
everyone is single if you're willing to try hard enough
trust lies at the core of love; there can be no true love without trust
she put him out, like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
""I don't feel like watching football, I would rather watch a good movie""--*PROPNAME*....manhood in question
False alarm...still invincible
Lovin' life!
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie!
tryin to figure out what to do w. a plane ticket to NYC the 24th w. no one to hang out with. FML!
Findin' a steady pay check for next year...
Composing a script for greek sing....will most definitely be epic!
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night!
I am officially the dumbest person in the entire world...my life sucks
I'm better than ya ex, gonna be better than ya next
<insert depressing, emo lyrics here>
FML!!
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T, do you know what that means?
I love PSU!
(801): You dropped me off at the wrong girl's house. (1-801): There's no such thing as a ""wrong girl"" make it happen. (801): alright see you in the morning.
Football all day...that's what I love about Sunday's
well everyone I know has got a reason to say, you could put the past away
State blows another opportunity...shouldn't have expected anything else...
last day of work! f'in right doggie!
Just got pizza delivered to my house in Pittsburgh by a chick I went to high school with in Coudersport...feel so much better about my life right now!
wicked salacity leads to anger and frustration
needs a formal date for Friday night...stat!
shorty's like a melody in my head
Lovin' this Hawaiian pizza!
WHITEOUT!!
i guess if that's what you're into...
Puzzling my face off!
ridiculous!
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking. And I plan on finding out what that is.
WPT, yes please!
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own.  Everybody has their private world where they can be alone. Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you...
I've had better...
Jammin' some *PROPNAME* on the new Trapp piano!
taking one step forward then 2 steps back...story of my life
has been working all week, it's time to play gonna get a little bit sideways
Chi-town for the weekend!
anotha day, anotha dolla
recovery day
Don't worry about the people in your past, there's a reason they didn't make it to your future.
she said, ""you probably don't remember me,"" I said, ""only every other memory.""
All the classy broads hit up half price wine night right?...
Round 2...
Tattoo on the lower back...might as well be a bulls-eye
Turkey Bowl at Beaver Stadium...sick!
Tailgating in the Wendy's parking lot is the new thing to do!!
another lonely night with nothing to hold on to but memories of better days...
PSU this weekend? obvi!...
PHI is callin' my name!
scars heal, glory fades, and all we're left with are the memories made. pain hurts, but only for a minute. your life is short so go on and live it, cause the chicks dig it
you're not sure that you love me, but you're not sure enough to let me go
ugh! rough weekend!
85 and sunny in Jamaica, 82 and sunny in Grand Cayman....SMICK!
terrible night!
is trying to justify his CMU education in exchange for the PSU atmosphere...not really working
hang on tight, cause it's gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride
4 rounds of credit card roulette shots and never had to pay...love that!
Man date at Hokkaido...SMAAART!
false alarm. still invincible.

Okay, people, seriously...""lol"" is so blood annoying when you use it on every line.
QTD: ""'Flower' usually refers to a vulva in general, not virginity or 'cherry popping' as the kids would say."" Hahahaha
Reading an amazing book called Stranger in a Strange Land. Now I'm listening to Loveline and trying to rest for the god-aweful full day tomorrow.
I have to find the superhero I use to be. I can't bring myself to believe it was just the Love of a silly boy that did it.
Blah ! Work lots, need money. Not worth it really. I'm loosing the happiness !!
Now that I'm done writing, I need food...hmmm....
""For a moment I love everything I see and think and feel...""
Easy to read; I like that !
Frustrated beyond all hell, blog isn't helping.
Aggrevated that I let someone else take me from really happy to hurt and depressed. It's on me to change my reaction to be one of Loveful Me.
Doctors seem to want me to sit out. In a wheelchair...no fucking way. I'd rather walk down the street with tears streaming, than be benched....which, unfortunately, is not too far off.
I am what I make of myself. I am Love. I am.
Gah, head's pounding. I wish I wasn't in so much pain. It makes the pills that much more tempting...
Off to a training, not back til Sunday. So tired. So in pain. Starbucks will make it all better, I know it !
Alright, recharged as it were. If this is a night of no dark dreams; you are a miracle worker too.
Got the new iPhone 3GS. Don't ask how, I won't tell you. But thank you.
""Little red bird under a chair, waiting for the crumbs to fall. Daddy said, 'Get a job'. Well don't you see, Daddy, how good I am at catching crumbs ?""
Wow, fresh air. Crazy. Good day sunshine, you're my favourite star.
Just ate a nice happy cow filet with red wine reduction. Wish my feet weren't throbbing so I could really cook !! Tomorrow we shall throw down...my 12-in skillet and me.
I just....I can't do this without family...friends. Anybody ?
Last day at work. I caught myself laughing at something horrific last night. Laughter is how I cope, but...I can't wait to laugh at happy things again.
Home...finally. Sooooo tired...gonna get a couple hours before work starts up again.
Okay, I'm no good at positivity right now. That's my work ""hat"". So sue me.
Sleeeeeeeeeep......
I don't know where my mind is in this moment. It's so fleeting; emotion. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. And like *PROPNAME* says, a shotgun just leaves a messed up wall.  Ah well. Random thoughts. Better go to bed before that crap goes deeper.
Ah coffee....makes the world go 'round.
I need to be asleep. I get up in....5 hrs ? No idea really. What am I doing again ?
Okay, sleep. Dreaming of bacon and dark chocolate. mmmm....
Wow been a tiring and painful day. Gonna set up a movie and try to relax. Love to all of my beautiful friends and family for the support and awesomeness of who they are. And a high five to my Surgeon who is THE man and gives me hope of having a less painful life. <3 you all. You make me happy, yes YOU.
Well anyway, fuck it. I'm gonna die young but happy. Rather than healthy and old.
Today was a much needed day off !! Back to a fake smile tomorrow, but rejuvinated by friends tonight.
""I like my chicken fried, a cold beer on a friday night, a pair of jeans that fit just right, and the radio up !""
Having surgery today. I can't wait to be in hospital. I'm not a big fan of surgery. But hospitals feel like home to me. Calming in the chaos.
Gonna be 83 degree today ! Coffee, sunshine, and sweet email from a friend. Day started with love, is continuing, and will end in love.
I wish I was in NYC and seeing *PROPNAME* tomorrow night....
Some people say pain can be controlled by the mind. I do not agree with these people. It doesn't mean I don't admire them though.
I always want the blog to be the magical valve. Turn it on, write, be healed. It never is though. And now I still hurt, I just feel more raw now. As long as I stay with the emotion and don't deny...I'll be alright.
Again, my company and night are ruined by some physical ailment of mine. I am fucking tired of it.
""I've been high, and I've been down, my head in the clouds and my hands on the ground. ""
Pain is a bitch.
Getting together map, snacks, music, and up-all-night accessories for Hollywood. Will starting driving at 4 am.
I feel emptied out; please rain down on me...darkness and light, come fill me up.
I need to go back to my live food diet. Not 90% like before, but I bet I could do 75% without losing too much weight..
I guess it all depends on your mood...why can't these meds be any damn good ?
Okay, so what are the different plans for Friday night in LA ? There's *PROPNAME*...?
""I believe in love. It's just my heart that keeps turning me down. I believe in love, I think it's just fine.""
My mind is so confusing, it's scary.
My most awesome friend just surprise-attacked me with a present of a dark chocolate bacon bar...drool. Best. Moment. Ever.
Writing, then 2 chapters homework, then bed. Or just Loveline ?
Fucking hell, grrrr....
(Breast cancer awareness question - what colour bra are you wearing ?) No colour. I'm not a fan of bras lately. But this is a stupid FB idea. It doesn't really raise awareness unless you also say what the hell it's about !  Stupid, stupid.
""Walking by the river I...reach my hands to cup the sky. It runs down my arms...a bitter blue. Turn to red, and the gashes grew."" God, this song...every word is raw and honest.
I find I'm enjoying tiny poetry.  Such as: Rain- My ears hear a drip, drop, splash It's more of a scream, laugh, live And you make it so hard not to be cliche. You pile on my dreams,  Like power lines on a sky. Is it raining where you are ?
Fuck. Okay, file another tragic story in a box of my mind to be dealt with when I no longer have a heart. Wonder how much longer it'll take...not too long now.
Not tired, must sleep. Long week ahead, and no weekend. Friday is no longer a day off. Sore all over, but I asked for it. Cig, Loveline, sleep...smile, love, remember.
Loveline, pills, and a kitty. Best combo ever. night.
Okay, must sleep. Must work in mere hours...ah who am I kidding ? I don't sleep. Or eat. Just smoke...and work. And love.
My most Awesome Surgeon says I can try walking today and if all goes well, I can work tomorrow !! YAY !! I'm gonna need the money if I wanna try and quit this job to focus on my other jobs//opportunities. Wish me luck on the walking ! I'll report back.
I did that shit with spasms, AND after 8 shots of espresso today. WHO DA MAN ?? Beauty school, here I come...right after this next Criminal Minds. <3
Fucking musicians. Fuck musicians...
It's ugly here. But there are sparks...moments. Love.
It's moments like this that I wish I worked for Walmart. I hate rape. I'm no good at counseling ""victims"". Especially when it's a parental perpetrator. Why is this the way of the world ? Why is it reality ?
Gah, headache. Okay my body's failing me; I'm going to put off work 'til tomorrow and take care of myself now. Ice cream, giant sweater, warm bed...I'm comin'.
<3
Okay. Maybe not sleep.
To be something I am not...that is what I'll be when I grow up. God, it'll be stunning.

missed my connecting flight from atlanta to rio last night, i now have to spend 24 hours in atlanta to catch the same flight later today.  it's under freezing here, and i have no long-sleeve tops and a single pair of jeans.  Hello hotel room!  Time for movies!  I think I might be coming down with a cold too... wow, I hope it's a quick one that just goes away.
has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on *PROPNAME* to win vs *PROPNAME* to win against *PROPNAME*.  Any other winners is a tie. I figure *PROPNAME* is about 3:1 & *PROPNAME* is about 7.5:1 I loooove my bet right now (no odds!)  I wanted to book more action last night vs *PROPNAME* when I saw him at the Bellagio, but he doesn't like his side anymore.  Ship the EV kidd!!!!!
back from vid's wedding.. it was a blast!  Congratulations to them both.  I am ready for some more high stakes gambling in Las Vegas.  One time!
is on a mission in the gym.  My body is changing daily, and I feel and think better then I have in a while.  Exercise: the only healthy drug!
is playing the main event today, day 1B
back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a reality
wow... mass effect 2 just arrived.  //life
has left the country.  Enough poker at the WSOP, time to travel around a bit!
is finally in Brazil after 2 whole days of travelling
is leaving Manila in a few hours for Nice, France...
is a relatively short stack going in to day 3 of the Bellagio 15k tourney... about to leave to go play now.
is playing the FTOPS main event in his hotel in Nice... trying to stay patient tho i'm tired from a day of travelling and just want to sleep.  Tomorrow I go for a week on a yacht... more R&R + fun people + a whole lotta gambling... sounds like a slice of heaven.
is posting this from 30,000 feet above the surface of the earth, somewhere over nebraska in an airplane.  Wow, what an amazing world we live in!
thanks to my mom for an amazing feast... I just crashed out afterwards and caught up on 15 hours of sleep.  Now I'm up early in Poway and ready to go!  Who's out there???
15k at bellagio today... off to the races
Out of the Main Event... my 11k didn't make it far into Day 2.  I've been playing cash games non-stop for the last two days though.  Probably going to play again today... Now that I'm out, planning to come to *PROPNAME*'s wedding
is back in vegas, ready to win the main event! ... not really b//c i'm never going to win a tournament.  hopefully I can take down a few $$$ anyways =)
wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions.
I think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard.
is up and down in the WSOP cash games... and he just finished reading Brave New World by *PROPNAME* & Death by Black Hole by *PROPNAME*.  Both books were good.
is up a little too early in the morning (9:30AM)... and doesn't know what to do with himself.  I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (*PROPNAME*)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solid
what a night last night... my liver took one for the team
back in San Diego for xmas
wow - i just played COD4MW2 all night with 3 buddies... I felt like I was back in college
finished Fooled by Randomness... it's an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone.  I'm now 80 pages into Chaos by *PROPNAME* and am enjoying it.  Go reading!
does not know anything about the destruction of any RVs outside of Las Vegas in the desert.
just went paintballing in SD... always a great time!  The bruises go away after a few days, but the memories of capping your friends last a lifetime.
What a beautiful life... my family, my friends... amazing. If I could have one ""genie in the bottle"" wish, not including any kind of life extension, I think I would take perfect knowledge.  i.e., complete knowledge of everything already known and possibly knowable to the human mind (excluding future events)
is thinking maybe he needs to go visit peeps at some point in Cali now that he's single and has no excuse not to.  Holla San Francisco & San Diego =)   ... Just gonna add that to my ToDo List here... get around to that at some point... (wow im hopeless)
thinks Backgammon is fun!!
taking care of last minute business... because tomorrow I'm going to Brazil =)
did full-fledged bikram for the first time (a 90-minute class as opposed to the 60 minute classes i had already done)... and it was hard!  Damn, I feel great now though =)
just rolled out of bed, not sure what the plan for the day is yet.  but who really cares?  i'm just happy to be going along for the ride
wow, I got d-r-u-n-k last night... hangover in full effect.  mike gets in today, and I think we are all going to the lake.  I might actually get a little sun... don't worry I'll have sunscreen =)
read *PROPNAME*'s ""Check Raising the Devil"" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching ""The Universe"" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik
is chillin in Boracay at the Shangri-La.  This place is beautiful!  I just got out of farm country in the Philippines, and got massacred by mosquitoes.  Need a few days of sun and relaxation to recover.  =)
feels like doing things is hard.
Thanks to the beauty of anythingyouwantdelivery.com ... I have CallOfDuty4MW2 on the way right to my place right now, for just a small delivery charge (along with some Chipotle)... I've been hearing amazing things about it (best fps since Counterstrike)... and I might have to do a little gaming
is stoked bc a big grocery store, a nice gym, and a pinkberry (best after workout carbs ever..) are all within 1 block of my penthouse in Ipanema.  Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heaven
is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten.
has started doing Hot Yoga, and really enjoys it.  I think I'll make it a habit!

loves that she has some of the nerdiest friends ever. She's seen at least ten *PROPNAME* poems posted today. Granted, everyone picks the same one from V for Vendetta, but m'eh.

Damn, those Eagles looked sharp today. Too bad the Red Sox couldn't do the same.

can be painfully petty and selfish at times.
had an amazing night last night, in spite of the fact that she was literally falling asleep on her feet.
wants to live where soul meets body, and let the sun wrap its arms around her, and bathe her skin in water cool and cleansing, and feel, feel what it's like to be new.
is tired of being passed over.
doesn't look different, but she has changed. You're looking through her, she's not the same.
One more double before nine days of freedom.
has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer.
took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise.
doesn't want to be at the mercy of her emotions. She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.
is feeling uninspired and unmotivated. Can someone else please pay her bills and move her into her new apartment?
had good talkings tonight. Fun times were had by all.
is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head.
needs to be herself, she can't be no one else. She's feeling supersonic, give her gin and tonic. She could have it all, but how much does she want it?
is glad that it's summertime, and the living is easy. One of these mornings, she'll rise up singing.
is having the worst day since yesterday.
Woot, go Chiefs. :D
is simultaneously packing, doing laundry, cleaning, and jamming out.  Ah, productivity.
I'm leavin' on a cruise ship, but I do know when I'll be back again. Seriously though, no phone or internet all week, so I will be incommunicado. You kids have fun, try not to do anything too crazy.
is still living with your ghost, lonely and dreaming of the west coast. She just wants to feel some sunshine.
has got no time to for spreadin roots, the time has come to be gone. And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on.
ought to be cast in the next big zombie movie as an extra. Because she feels like the living dead must feel after a night of heavy brain-eating. Is that their equivalent of drinking? Explains why they want to do it all the time.
just got home from spending 11 glorious hours with her family. It was an awesome day. Sorry for all the missed calls and texts, my phone died many hours ago.
just realized she's been awake for 22 hours. That might explain the exhaustion.

I did the Macarena with a pickle at the dinner table because the voices told me to.
is enjoying the cricket...comfy boxers and rainy weather...is it too soon for a beer?
So...*PROPNAME* can now count backwards from 10 :-)
needs beer...actually, any kind of alcohol will do...
can't believe that her son walked up to the Christmas tree stating 'J'. I was a little confused until he took a candy cane off the tree and proceeded to turn it upside down :-D
- so, this morning *PROPNAME* gets up to play and he goes over to the carpet where the light was shining through the blinds casting shadows...he then proceeds to tell me the different letters the sun is making on the carpet... 'I', 'T' and 'L' to be exact! He then somehow figured out how to cast his shadow over the sun to make the letters change & disappear! At this rate, he will be smarter than me before he goes to school!
is sick of being sick!
would like the rain back!
So...apparently, according to urban dictionary...A women named *PROPNAME* is typically very beautiful with an incredible body and nice eyes. They are known to be very loveable. *PROPNAME* are envied by other women...haha...I wish!

Home after two rehearsals back to back... whew time for some relaxation then a nice long sleep :)
Sunday wasn't quite as awesome, but it was still a good day :P
Is off to run some errands
likes that it really rained last night :)
is finally home :)
is further failing at life. Why do they give me extra bureaucratic hoops when I keep proving that I fail at jumping through them ><
Walk, then HW
And every time I've held a rose, it seems I only felt the thorns
Yay... beethoven is over!
Has 8 invites to google wave... I'd love to try it out with anyone that has a shared class with me. Let me know if you want in!
has been waking up obscenely early the last couple of days; is anyone up for breakfast now that I've been awake and hour and a half?
Sleep.
had a fantabulous week and would like thank all his SJ friends for making that happen. It was great to see all of you. :D
Wowza running tomorrow morning supa early
is unexplainably down :\
Congratulations All-hallowians, I enjoyed a wonderful concert!
blah....
need some time with my brain... time for a walk
Hates that he gets home from choir at 9:30 or 10:00 and glee doesn't go up online till about 1 am ><
*PROPNAME* just started working on his first Mozart Aria... a bit late but it'll have to do :)
cannot fall asleep ><
Is hoping his Sunday will turn out as well as his Saturday did.
loves beautiful music of every shape and size
will be in SJ as of tonight! He'll be in town till Saturday morning so call him and rescue him from the boredom that is his house.
MUST WORK, but the facebook demands my time!
thinks it's awesome that he's sitting in his room in a sweater because he left the window open during the day.
has HW for tomorrow and Wednesday that doesn't want to be done
is home and catching up on facebook :)
Laundry almost done... it was a lovely day for a walk
has one more day in San Jose before he disappears back to the otherness of Sacramento.
Would like to thank everyone for the wonderful birthday wishes... It's quite pleasant to be harrassed by facebook 1 day a year ;)
Thinks that chrome has come a long way since the first time he tried it, and has gotten fed up enough with Firefox that he's willing to give it another shot.
Autumn Cleaning Day
Transparent
is tired, and off to bed
a bit of relaxation and then an hour of Beethoven.
English English English
Question... does anyone actually use the poke feature on facebook anymore?
Classety Class class class... :\
Darn you *PROPNAME*'s... my insides are very unhappy :(
would like the world to know that this next week he intends to BE awesome and fix all of his problems.
No one should be frozen in carbonite, or be slowly digested for a thousand years in the bowels of a sarlaac, just because they couldn't pay *PROPNAME* what they owe him. If you agree, post this as your status.
Last day of adding... *fingers are crossed*
another week of school!!! yay.......
hates it when people are dishonest. :\

Urban Decay Primer Potion- I rub my eyes a lot and it still stays (wish it worked for mascara). Forever Makeup Aqua Eyes- gorgeous colors you will get tons of compliments, and it stays! Love to all :)
has been a negative person this week, and although the week is not up yet she will turn it around. Looking for hope to ward off the restlessness
ugh that *PROPNAME* has the face of a nightmare...ewww
watching ""Speak"" with pre-Twilight *PROPNAME*. Love her. So over this week. Need some Post Grad
has the place to herself this weekend...hhmmm
soooooooooooooo EXCITED to see *PROPNAME* cause she ROCKS! In the meantime I am lmao at www.notalwaysright.com
is going to go have a chill day. all is going to be good :)
is tired. is trying to get energy to get out. oh boo.
has only 3 more days left before she gives her life away for *PROPNAME*'s Market Week...sigh..lol
wants to be like the cute old couple on third avenue who sit outside, rain or shine, together happily watching people walk by...
needs one day at a time...sigh
is really missing her friends from back home. She loves each and everyone of you...you know who you special people are :)
is walking on sunshine! Cold weather, hot cocoa, New Moon coming soon, good food in the tummy, and a brighter outlook on life. Yay! It is true... those things do pass, and sometimes they need a helping kick out the door. :) lol
is sooo happy. Things are coming together. So grateful for all the wondeful people in life that make it so great. Just so so so so happy!
wants to pose a question...if you could go back to several times in your life you wish you could do differently would you?
IT'S A SUNSHINE DAY!!! laaa
is in need of sleep and clean laundry
is happier today. Today was better. She talked to her supervisor, and an amazing thing happened...things got better. Oh and life is good with Thai food. YUMMY!! I love you....
has no idea where the time has gone. August? Seriously? Where did July go?
is not knowing what to do with the time she has on her hands. Park, stalking squirrels? Ugh...Does anyone need to hire an assistant? Boo
the best ways to get rid of Moody Mondays, and the past few days of moodiness are to talk to mom, volunteer, talk to *PROPNAME*, watch an amazing episode of Dexter, and be thankful for all the blessings in life that are free for the taking :)
had a great time in the snow, seeing ""Mr. Big"" with *PROPNAME*and *PROPNAME*, and is happily relaxing now...but such a pity about *PROPNAME*. Live life to the fullest :)
wants to be like *PROPNAME* and do a monologue of all her thoughts and feelings. If only the audience were up to it. Hmmm...
is listening to *PROPNAME* like it is her job, is hungry and unsure of what to eat, and is questioning everything and yet nothing....blah hungry like a wolf!
just cried like a small child for *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*'s wedding. I want to marry *PROPNAME*...so beautiful
is soooo sleepy.....zzzzzzzzzzzzz
spending her Saturday night home watching movies with Hot Cocoa. Yum!
going out with the coolest chica EVA! *PROPNAME*, would you go on a date? Perhaps it is fate!
got Skype, and is still figuring out how to use it...like in that she has no idea how to since she just downloaded it...
drum roll please...76.5 hours this week of working. :) Going back in at 7:30, then it is over Tuesday..yay
is happy to see no rain, hopes it lasts, is excited for what comes next, misses buddies back home, appreciates the buddies she is making up here
is happy things are coming together for her job and self-wise...is a lot busier than she realized...feels good about keeping her resolution to be selfish to herself...and is letting other people make the effort, and it is great :)
brokan lttrs hart hot ppl lif goo kim kool
is lost, but in 2010 hopefully she will find her way and is making a promise to put herself first :)
listening like crazy to the Glee soundtrack, happy in her very clean room, excited for new beginnings, grateful for today, tomorrow, and everyday, even the bad ones :) a hug for everyone!
had delicious Thai food, needs to clean tomorrow, and is excited about getting busy at her new job
just got a call for an interview for a job she applied for back in June. Go figure. Sometimes things take time. Cross your fingers :)
feels a bit lost sigh that is life
clocked in 14 hours today. Smiled at *PROPNAME* like a moron as she walked by...umm how was I to know what she looked like? At least I know who she is. Fashion is hard. Models are very nice though. Til next Tuesday...
is having one of those days, but thankfully has come to the realization that moments do pass and tomorrow is a new day and the problems of this week will be a faded memory when next week comes around.
is very cold, feeling jumpy, and ahhhhhhhh
can't wait til New Moon!
feels like it is off to the first day of school tomorrow, has the cleanest room ever, and is really happy :)
is happy for the new year and is excited for all the wonderful things that are here now and are in the future :) xoxo
New York Marathon happening right outside her window. WOOOO
squeals of little girl delight! Going home to South Florida tomorrow! Been over 6 months :)
is sleepy, excited, and wondering...
has one extra day then she expected and begins her hardcore assignment Sunday, not Saturday. One day of extra rest never hurt anyone :)
was not impressed with Gossip Girl tonight. It better step it up, or I'm no longer watching
has a bump on her head she has no idea where it came from, loves the cold weather, feels like a weight has been lifted from her, and is confident in her choices here on out.
is sleepy, loves *PROPNAME*'s new blog, *PROPNAME*'s remodeled blog, *PROPNAME*'s new makeup, and is so pumped for New Moon!!! Did she mention she has the new CD and loves it?
wants to go see Harry P. and would love to go back to sleep, but there is stuff that needs to get done. Booo...
is not loving the new gig, is praying something better comes along, and would like to see the new Harry P movie. Oh and could use a long nap
is feeling better...the rain cleanses...vule vooo
is going to see The Lovely Bones, cause it is already out in NYC..yay!
needs a love song that speaks of boots that take your breath away, or the sadness inside you feel when a beautiful piece of clothing costs more than a teeth cleaning. No more of this stuff about wishing a guy//girl would love you. How about wishing you had a place to wear a $3,000 gown? Could afford a $3,000 gown? :)
so tired after The Great Urban Race with Stella. She is a rock solid awesome teammate. Now off to D&B to celebrate the big 24 with *PROPNAME*! Yay busy and fun weekends!
is so happy it is friday. laundry, library, sleep. ahhh
can't sleep. Wishing she was 10 years old, and not about to be 24. Misses people, misses less worries, wishes people kept promises of yesterday, wishes things were as easy as swiping a credit card in life...
black
is not really good at catching up on sleep
is a bit stressed
my toe hurts, i hate work, i am tired. i am so not a grown up...
#&*(@^!)& &*()!&*(#^!(*)@!*( ^*!&*(
is going to chill tonight, maybe order thai, and just relax....
is kinda confused....sigh
is still thinking about how amazing the season finale of Dexter was...wow. And is now hooked on Lost...she gets it now. Still agonizing over seeing Boone go bye bye...sexy sexy man
met 2 girls named *PROPNAME* in line at Duane under the age of one, saw *PROPNAME* in the latest issue of GQ, and is happy that buying a new toothbrush head makes her believe in the world of new and wonderful possibilities. Love to all today and every other :)
is just not able to win on Vampire Wars..booo..at least she lives in NYC! Yay!
is surprised that *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* are engaged. Found out not at Perez..
- smile and the whole world smiles with you. - motivation, not desperation will get you what you want. - the only way to go is up. - family is always there for you, and having even a handful of reliable friends makes life even better :)
is in need of a nap.
wants someone to see My Sister's Keeper with her!!!!!!!!!
is not loving the rain. sigh
is going to see *PROPNAME*..WOOO...is going to see *PROPNAME*...WOOO! So psyched!!!!
thanks you so much for all the birthday wishes! She had a really amazing time :) xoxo
is looking at old photos...and is kinda glad she takes them off facebook every so often, so that she has them all to herself, and it helps her make sure she keeps moving forward  ;)
used to like facebook more, but it just is not the same...maybe it is time to change things up...

(self-with-other knowledge) -- ""... the self is in fact entagled at both the interpersonal level with specific others in one's life and at the collective level in relation to the social groups with which one identifies. At a cognitive level, this implies that linkages exist in memory between significant-other representations and the self, as well as between knowledge designating social categories and the self.""

I feel like its the end of an era in Gator football! : (  I am so lucky and thankful I got to go to UF when I did! Thank you Tebow and thank you Urban!
So I was watching the news in Thai and they showed a picture of the Earth and the Sun and a big comet like solar flare thing circling the Sun. .Umm is there something I should know? Do I need to find a bomb shelter? I am so out of the news loop, I found out the US health bill passed on Facebook for god sakes!
Thank you everybody! Love you all!
An extremely attractive girl whos flirty personality and curvacious figure will keep you coming back for more. She's typically a brunette but occasionally acts blonde. She enjoys long relationships and has many close guy friends. Often mistaken for a ""slut"" but really isn't. She can also be a super bitch if you get onto her bad side. ""dude, i want to hang out with that girl, shes such an *PROPNAME*"" haha
Just got to Thailand! Korean Air= best airlne ever! But sitting for 20 hours sucks no matter how good the movies are.
I love *PROPNAME*, I can't believe she died : (
I was one of the lucky ones to get air conditioning and internet in my apt in Thailand! Yay!
12 days and counting... . oh and Surrogates sucked! Save your money unless your want to see a crappy version of I Robot.
Do I have a celebrity look-a-like?
""Just let me live my life"" -*PROPNAME*
I'm wondering if I can make it through another 3 days of singing ""head, shoulders, knees and toes"" 10 times each day.
At the beach in Bang Saphan! Didn't know how much I'd missed the water till I got here!
A kid in my class put a frog down another kids shirt today, along with the branches the frog was in.  After the frog, leaves and branches fell out of his shirt, the boys spent 5 minutes trying to catch the frog, while I (the teacher) stood in the corner with the screaming girls afraid of the frog. Then the frog peed on the boy who caught it. Thank God it's a short school week!
Mash Potatoes were a big hit in Thailand!
Going ot Ko Chang Island to hopefully ride some elephants!
Avatar was AMAZING! I loved it. Spend the money and see it in IMAX 3-D. I promise it's worth it!
Looking to go to the Gator game if anyone is selling a ticket (student or non)
Lesson planning sucks. . .so I'm procrastinating.
Class of 40 kids. . .3 showed up. .because it rained. That would never fly in Florida!
Is getting anxious about Thailand and money :{
Is not looking forward to this reeeeeally long flight!
I was woke up at 7:30 in the morning on Sun by my mother informing me of the Gator loss. If I wasn't so hungover I probably would have cried. : ( I still love you Gators!
Lame Canada! Sorry neighbors to the north, but after China�s opening Olympic ceremony 2 years ago, that was just weak. Even *PROPNAME* can�t show up 10,000 in sync drumming Chinamen. Glad the U.S. didn�t get the bid for 2010 lol.
Not doing too well in the coordination department today. I ran the motorbike up some stair this morning and almost ate it just now (yet again on some stairs)
Could I be anymore bored?
Never seen a 10 year old and a 60 year old driving a motorcycle on the same steet until today :)
Why is there always a ""gunman"" on USF campus. . .didn't have to worry about that crap in Gainesville!

Am I the only one that hates the new shakira song?!! It's horrible!
After teaching for just 3 weeks, I finally understand the importance coffee plays in people's everyday lives.
It�s hilarious trying to explain Easter to the Thai children. �Yeah . . so there�s this rabbit that comes to your house and hides eggs. . yes eggs . .and then you eat chocolate that�s shaped like rabbits and eggs . . and that�s how we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ� haha. They either have a really confused look on their face or just laugh.
Last day in Ko Chang : (  but teaching starts Monday : )
Tahtako is small and no one speaks English, but the people are friendly!

And yes, I misspelled ""watching"" not once, but twice.
CCHS Jv - you girls rock!  what else can I say?  And mega shout-out to *PROPNAME* for moral support  tonight and rockin' programs.
Yea CCHS JV - starting off the season with a WIN!
at work on a sunday - but at least the steelers won last night!
steelers, steelers, steelers!
Lazy day around the house after the family has left.
Put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered the LOSS of a Baby ? The majority won't put it on because unlike cancer. Baby Loss is a taboo... Break the Silence ? This is in memory of all the Angel Babies...gone too soon but NEVER FORGOTTEN ABOUT!!? Show your support and let these women know they don't have to grieve alone.
Anyone in the pitttsburgh area able to work the polls on tuesday?  I've got a friend that needs help.  Let me know.  Thanks.
It'a kinda like de ja vu - working at home, wathcing the *PROPNAME* (Steelers) game, and snow is still on the ground.  Good thing I know its Sunday!
I have the best boyfriend ever.  Thanks babe, I love you!
preparing for tryouts and the start of Steelers season . . . its that time of year again!
Really?  Two days in a row?  I would like to take back my comment about de ja vu - I didn't mean I wanted it to end like that (again).
If you & I woke up in jail together...using only FOUR words...what would you say to me? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say....(And if you make a comment, you gotta put this in your status. Fair is fair.)
Working at home, wathcing the *PROPNAME* game, and watching the snow.  The words ""lazy Saturday"" come to mind.
here we go, steelers, here we go!
Wow, that was a great game - even if *PROPNAME* did lose. Hope the 1 v. 2 game tonight is that good.
Steelers, Steelers, Steelers
If I ruled the world . . . imagine that . . .
How does that kind of fallen even happen that quickly?

Went to a surprise *PROPNAME* game yesterday (surprise for me, not for the players) and had a fantastic time.
Saw District 9. So real. So good. So stressful.

Listless....better snap out of it soon

Just back from Scotland (the brave)! In Raleigh this week, hit me up.
Rainy days = warm food. Its worth it.
Needs job//money to support hobbies other than studying....
Wishes she was at Raleigh Undercover, so if you are in NC and not there, get out and show some charity love while hanging out with awesome people who like good music. I will be very jealous.
Should be doing work, but isn't (obviously). Yay dance class tonight! Shimmy shimmy shimmy....
Mmm Soup.
hates discussion forums. You always end up looking pompous, idiotic or both. There's no winning.
can't wait to head outtt
Law Geekitude #107: I giggle to myself every time some old English judge uses the word ""mischief"" in an opinion.
Mmm mmm turkey stock
Relaxing after my delicious, noodly, post-exam lunch.
Monday comes too fast and too early.
Sick and tired. Literally.
doesn't actually condone vigilante justice...I really shouldn't skip lunch anymore...
Is going to get off her bum and go running sometime in the next 5 minutes...I promise!
hates legal writing. A lot. If I'm still awake at 3 am you'll know why.
is sooooo tired of legal practice homework.
Lord *PROPNAME* may have been a complete cad, but he could sure put pen to paper. (Still not studying as hard as I should be... can you tell?)
Had a minor(major) breakdown when I thought one of my exams was lost... but its all good now.
is getting very nervous about her first day of teaching SATs, moving, and school in august....and its all converging.
Oh to find an internship....
Might just vomit. I hate exams.
is in love with *PROPNAME* in downtown Raleigh. And *PROPNAME*.
Has no respect for anyone that doesn't understand the danger of being hit by a line drive. (Ahhhh torts).
Is going to do some comfort reading tonight (oh *PROPNAME* of Green Gables...) First real exam tomorrow ://
Hangin' with the Sadie-lady.
Survived her first day....
is surrounded by candy
hates noisy library-goers.
is sorry she didn't come to raleigh after telling everyone she would. But I went on a hike today and saw pretty nature-type things!
*PROPNAME* on Modern Family
wishes the weekend was longer. Yayyyyy NC! Yay Smancy!
Sunshine!!!
Going to NC tonight! Wish I was gonna make it for volleyball but if anyone is up for drinking after I just might be there....

Can't wait for Noon-thirty on Thursday!
Up figurin out school-ool-ool. Be back in NC this weekend.
Pro: I think I'm going to really like ethics. Con: I may have to rob a bank to pay for my books.
mmmmm...pint of Haagen-Dazs peach sorbet and no running. Doin' good today.
A storm's abrewin'! Snow is starting to stick....
Must sleep, must sleep. Too excited for the weekend.
I don't think I have a famous person....hmmmm....okay with that though.
DC friends: Giant snowball fight//snow kickball on the mall tomorrow, 3pm. There will be other snowball fights, but I will not be at them. So you should come to this one! :)
No more SAT class! Whoo whoo! But I'll miss the kids, they were a good lot once you got past the fact that they were teenagers....
Finally, one outline completely down...only 3 to go - and a long way to go at that. Next semester will be different, really!
My car is full of all my wordly possessions....ah the nomadic life.
overcast skies + homework + sore throat + boyfriend gone home = sad meagan. I'm coming to raleigh next weekend though!

In our personal and professional lives, we are constantly hit with one adversity after the other, most of which we have no control over. But the four things we have total control over is how we react, how we adapt, how we breathe and how we take action.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.� Steve Jobs

Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man?
is in a good mood, which is a nice change.
needs something to do tonight.

knows that a burning smell isn't the best sign of good cooking and is thus going to turn the heat down
doesn't know where anyone is!
is about to start wrapping Christmas presents!
is soon to become a member of the con club!! Whoop!
Last night I went to a conference where the police were asking us to pray for them. Lets pray for the police and our communities. God moves when his people pray.

regrets that he might have to dispose of his pumpkin (*PROPNAME*) as he is becoming a little furry and wonders if giving him a quick shave might do the job
Why doesn't social interview ask me any questions... I feel very left out. :(
apologises if he appears to be shouting or talking very loudly to people at the moment. He's getting used to talking to someone who is hard of hearing but keeps forgetting to talk normally to other people.
realised at around 5 last night that he had nothing to offer to trick-or-treaters so he made toffee... but then nobody came.

is missing *PROPNAME*
IS WORKING AWAY LIKE A WORKER ANT (PROVERBS 30:24-25) AND HAS THE CAPS LOCK ON!

is fighting to make it to the table football semis
""twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby..""
finds it highly amusing that we are currently bringing the milk inside to warm it up in the fridge!
What a busy morning! We had a plumber, the cleaner a dog walker and the gardener all around all at same time!
had a cooked breakfast this morning! mmm!
used every piece of loo roll from one roll (obviously not in one sitting) for the first time ever!
is now a graduate
has 1 essay left to write! and one to read through and amend where necessary! Then it is all gedonen!
Is it just me or does anyone else feel in the mood for an ABBA sing along session?
The Soup: The Verdict Type: Vegetable Appearance: Fantastic Texture: Good Taste: Poor Overall: Edible but not pleasant Summary: This is a great soup for looking at, it is full of colour, healthy vegetables and creaminess! If you are not hungry make this soup and you will feel good! However, if eating is your thing, this soup should be avoided. I have soup left for 3 meals - any takers? Only p&p to pay! Enjoy!

doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:)
Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit
did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house.
is happily watching Pixar short films on abc family while my DVR records *PROPNAME* on another channel:) Oh and I'm drinking my pumpkin spice coffee too! Life is good!
is getting very excited about decorating for Christmas! We are heading out to get a tree and all that fun stuff in a while:)
is feeling productive after posting *PROPNAME*'s care on autotrader. If anyone is possibly interested in a 2006 Honda Civic Si for ~$13500 let me know. I will post the link too once it's officially up on the site!
doing some online Christmas shopping
hanging out with *PROPNAME* :)
can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo!
*PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!!
just finished watching ""The Ugly Truth"", cute movie:)
off to the store to get the things I need to make caramel apple cookies. I hope that mine turn out as good as the picture! I also hope that they have the caramel bits I need at this Walmart!
Happy Halloween! Almost timet to make some snacks for the party tonight:)
thinks it might be time for a nap:)
just saw a commercial for Rihanna's 20//20 interview about her ordeal with *PROPNAME*...isn't it convenient that she is finally able to talk about it in an interview aired the day after her new album comes out?
is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;)
just finished watching "" Dear Zachary: a letter from a father to his son"". It was a pretty good documentary but very emotional...I suggest having tissues nearby
A bit mean...but damn funny Sarchasm : The gulf between the author of  sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it.
The feminine version of the name *PROPNAME* meaning ""the woman."" Basically never printed on magnets, mugs or other souvenir paraphernalia. Often mistaken for *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME* or *PROPNAME*. My name is *PROPNAME*, not *PROPNAME*, dammit. (Urbandictionary.com, type in your first name, copy and paste the first entry)
For once I meant to let my phone battery die all the way before recharging and did I remember to plug it in once it reached that point? Not until just now...oops
is wondering how many people get themselves screwed out of money by not paying attention and keeping records of stuff. I just added another $70 to my ""um no dumby actually I don't owe you that money"" total. Yay me:)
Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now!
doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Californication"" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other ""Dysfunctional family dramas""  This includes ""Dexter"" and ""Rescue Me"" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well.
feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames!
Happy Thanksgiving everybody! I'm thankful for friends to share Thanksgiving with:) Now time to make some yummy food to share later
wonders how sick Bon Jovi is of singing this song
had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:)
would like to know why our water is off
just heard a commercial on the radio about some pill to lower cholesterol. They actually said ""Do you have high cholesterol due to poor diet or lack of exercise? Then you need to try this""  No, actually you need to try improving your diet and exercising a bit first.  Just a crazy thought I had...
just had a wonderful chat with *PROPNAME* on the phone and is about to start making dinner:)
sad about the loss of the elephant calf at the Memphis Zoo:(
mmm peppermint mocha coffee creamer:)
is trying to decide what to stock the fridge with so there is a chance that *PROPNAME* will eat something besides fast food for 5 days that I'm gone! :)
had a great day with a wonderful friend and a wonderful evening with a great boyfriend. I'm one lucky girl:)
is taking *PROPNAME* to the vet for her annual check-up. I know it's good for her I just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much :(
*PROPNAME* brought me breakfast in bed this morning, hanging out with *PROPNAME* later, then a delicious pineapple pork chop dinner made by *PROPNAME* and watching a movie..what a great day it's going to be!:D
plans to sit on the couch watching movies all day.
has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug!
is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:(
The first 2 Atlantic tropical storms, *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*, have formed. I'm not too worried but have to admit there's a little unease about the idea of something making it here. Afterall, this is my first rodeo!
is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool.
is pretty sure I'm coming down with whatever *PROPNAME* considering I just folded a load of towels and now feel completely drained.  The good news is that the TV is working again:)
is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay!
Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said ""Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)..ummm...Goonies""
If *PROPNAME* San Diego and *PROPNAME* ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible.
is off to the gym again. I tried and can't think of a valid reason not to go, plus my legs aren't sore are at all from yesterday. I will will thank myself for this later:)
has a cold:(
is annoyed that GM decided it would be cool to have some stupid ass bracket for wiper blades on the G6 resulting in me having to pay $70 for replacement blades.
can't believe it. I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays!
is making sweet potatoe split pea soup. I hope it's good!
is glad that we waited to watch Wolverine as a rental.
is excited about dinner and movie date night:)
is watching a movie:)
is happy to have a new working DirecTV box. I can open the guide and switch channels without it freezing....and the DVR works. I can now go back to waiting until a few minutes into a show before I start watching and then fast forward through commercials!
is making rice krispies treats!
accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone!
starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later
almost time to make white chicken chili with cheddar jalepeno hushpuppy crust. It's going to be even better than usual 'cause we finally have some fall weather here!
is making spaghetti sauce. Yum!
was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*!
Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f**k was going on when I first saw it.
is not happy that our A//C is not working. Grrrr
I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes.
Thanks for all the birthday wishes yesterday! I had a great day:)
is happy to finally be home for a while after lots of running around lately!
perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :)
is watching ""The Proposal"". *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*...even if the movie is crap it won't be a total waste:)
went to see ""The Hangover"" tonight then came home to enjoy a nice relaxing jacuzzi tub bath with a glass of wine...life doesn't get much better than that!
Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it!
why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved.
is off to the gym!
set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken!
had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:)
is home from the Lockport Mardi Gras parade and is ready for a nap!
shooting and punching some stuff in Borderlands:)
has a cold and is curled up on the couch resting.
is not having a good night. Watching some TV then heading to bed.
is off to bed and hoping not to be woken up by things flapping and crashing from the crazy wind outside. On the up side it's going to be in the 60-70 range for the next week!:)
wasn't very impressed with ""Taking of Pelham 123"" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.  Ha
didn't think that coming to take care of the water heater first thing in the morning meant 11...I guess there's still 45 mins until it afternoon!
Bad news: Novocaine is wearing off so my mouth is hurting a bit now. Good news: I can now drink my pumpkin spice latte without dribbling:)
was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid Saints remixes came on the radio. I'm all for that kind of thing when I actually go to games, but I'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio.
is making some grub
blue
is nervous about getting cavities filled for the first time ever tomorrow:( The up side is that it probably isn't as bad as repair work from stepping on a shovel;) There I feel a bit better now!
is a huge nerd and posting books on paperback swap:)
Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:)
is doing some major housecleaning!
""You try growing up in a trailer park with nothing but dust mites and Lithuanians and see where that gets you""..a line from a terrible movie on netflix on demand, but it made me giggle
How many times is it appropriate to say ""What?"" before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said?
just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories. Now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right? Kidding:)

About the clutter.  *PROPNAME* and I are playing Farmville.  This generates messages on Facebook, messages that are of no interest to anyone not playing.  To stop seeing this clutter, follow these steps: point your mouse at one of the offending items.  The word ""hide appears in the upper right.  Click the word ""hide"".  Additional options appear.  Click ""Hide Farmville."" You still we see any of our other items.
Noticed that the FDIC closed SEVEN banks today.  Usually it is zero, one, two, or three.  Last week it was five.  That was a little bit disturbing.  But seven?  Query: will it always be a prime number?
My cat is looking for the door into summer.
Note in my homeowner's insurance policy: ""Discharge of a nuclear weapon shall be deemed a warlike act, even if accidental.""  You can be sure that I will call and complain immediately if our house is destroyed by a nuclear weapon.
If you find yourself wondering about things such as ""how long of a time period is 17% of eight hours?"" and it makes your brain hurt to figure it out in your head, you can go to Google and type in ""17% of eight hours"" and it will tell you.
*PROPNAME* got here last night.  The t-shirts and cherries came this morning.  Thank you, everyone.
When I was younger I would record my favorite songs onto a piece of papyrus.
Hard drive problem?  Made funny noises twice and failed to boot.  Finally booted (obviously).  I am going to install a new one now.  Don't expect updates for a few minutes (hah!).  Of course the last time this happened, I installed a new drive, used the old one for backup, and the old continued working for years.  So this could all be a waste of time and money.
did not expect to see snow, whilst planting daffodil bulbs.
Thanks everyone for all the help.  At this point, Ijust need 1 harmess, 2 horseshoes, 2 nails, and 2 boards; no bricks.  I can give gifts of harnesses and horseshoes, as of this moment.
Has extra tickets for the University of Chicago graduation.   ... Can you believe it?  Stand in the rain for 45 minutes, then nobody even bothers to take your tickets when you get to the event.
put his hat on, and spent much of the afternoon collecting mesquite and yucca seeds, then buying them all over the place.  Few will ever sprout.  But some will.
*PROPNAME* and I planted four trees on Monday, and today we got an inch of rain. There are two pecan trees (to pollinize each other), an all-in-one almond (two varieties grafted, so no additional pollinizer needed), and a pomegranate (self-pollinizing).  Life is easy, sometimes.
100% of people will not copy and paste this.
says Thank You So Much to everyone who helped to make The Graduation a Huge Success!
got twenty pounds of freshly-roasted chile today.  Now my Subaru will have a delightfully spicy aroma for a week or two.
Here's what I tell anybody and this is what I believe. The greatest gift we have is the gift of life. We understand that. That comes from our Creator. We're given a body. Now you may not like it, but you can maximize that body the best it can be maximized. --Mike Ditka No thanks. --jcy
No snow yet down south, but it is raining.  Snow is expected, but only a trace.
is back online, after four days with no modem.
0.7 inches of rain!!!
is glad that his car is not infested with Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches.
If you seek a pleasant peninsula...
Lunch: salad, with tuna and DRIED MICHIGAN CHERRIES.  Thanks, Mom.
Has anyone figured out how to filter the Facebook feeds, using the new Facebook page?  I will be annoyed if this functionality has been lost.
I won't post any downer economic collapse articles this weekend; only growing things.
4 inches of rain in the last 36 hours, with more to come.  (Normal is 8 inches per year.)  Plus there is snow on the mountains.
I have not blocked anyone.  Disregard any notice to the contrary.
""If hard work were such a wonderful thing, surely the rich would have kept it all to themselves."" --J *PROPNAME*,  former President of the AFL-CIO
also watches the chickens (6) after work.
tried transplanting palo verde trees today.  We'll see how they do.  If I can get one to grow by the arroyo, then everyone downstream will have them too. Eventually.
is irritated that, the day after he got his new modem, the blogging service went down for an upgrade.
No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day.
is sad to see *PROPNAME* go, but very happy he was able to be here.

Did anyone see *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME* this week on Dancing with the Stars?  Whew...now, that's what I call dirty dancing!
Don's taking a fork-lift test tomorrow to see if he qualifies to bump back in - keep those fingers crossed!
is half way through her weekend conference ;)
24 hours without the kids -- I miss my babies!
has 99 friends, so why is it that I feel the need for one more?
*PROPNAME* fell off the couch last night and fractured the bone just above her right elbow so we spent most of the night in the ER and most of this afternoon at the orthopedics office before bringing her home in a pretty purple cast for Christmas
is home lovin' on my kids....oh, and my hubby too ;)
Well, the fork-lift job is a no go.  Apparently, he wasn't fast enough - considering he's never driven a fork-lift before - and they don't have time to train him...on to plan B, I suppose

All I wanted was the dictionary but I ended up reading about things from string theory to the genetic destiny of the y-chromosome (apparently men are on the slow but certain path towards extinction...) for most of the afternoon

""all we have is hope and love, so don't you worry child, so don't you worry 'bout a thing in the night, for those can lift us up so we can rise, so we can rise above the madness"" -*PROPNAME*

is going into a morphine-induced slumber
That is a problem. That is not trusting the nowness properly that what is the actual experience now possesses a lot of powerful things. It is so powerful that we can't face it. Therefore, we have to borrow from the past and invite the future all the time. Maybe that's why we seek religion. Maybe that's why we march in the street. Maybe that's why we complain to society. Maybe that's why we vote for the presidents.
is regaining her colors and fitting into her skin again :D

wonders if serfs living under a nationalized health care scheme lead healthier lifestyles mostly for fear of becoming sick//injured and having to throw themselves at the mercy of its poor services.
remembers the good old days when we could pay for everything under the sun by ""bringing the troops home"". It amazes me how inconsistent we can be when the Birkenstock is on the other foot.

is looking forward to a steak dinner tonight in celebration of four years together as a couple.
just began his first involuntary, five-day furlough. So sad.
was happy to learn it wasn't a furlough but a scheduling mistake that created the lapse. Back to work tomorrow.
rarely ever gets sick. Hopefully this will pass quickly.

*PROPNAME* is hilarious.

reminds those engaging in civil discourse; when you have to resort to accusations of racism, you're probably losing the debate.
Happy Thanksgiving
is pondering the contradictions in his fidelity to a jealous mistress.
is pleased the American people will now have the time to read the government-run health care bill or have it interpreted for them. Apparently, this is a luxury our representatives (and President) couldn't find the time in their busy schedules to accomplis

An Obama consultant yesterday on taxing high-value, middle class health care plans: ""We're not talking about a new tax on these people. We're saying they currently get an enormous tax break and we're going to slightly scale that back . . ."" This will likely be the talking point for any new, middle-class taxes to come.

was greatly disappointeed with the disgustingly partisan scriptwriting on Law and Order last night.
wonders, what's the use of having a bulwark against cloture if you can't exercise party discipline anyway.
We have growth, but at the price of future jobs--all the while paying five times as much for the same car we would've bought later. What else can be done to keep up this facade of recovery? We're already printing more money than ever before. We can't raise taxes without calling it a fee, because dear leader wants to be re-elected. Can we still hit the brakes before this public-private hybrid goes into a ditch?
loves USPS. When you underpay for online postage, they charge you at the counter. When you overpay, they pocket the difference and say ""thank you"". Isn't that just the Federal government in a nutshell?

*PROPNAME* was bad enough, but at least he distorted data and concocted fear-mongering chartsngrafs to support his cockamamie theory. The Norwegian Nobel Committee just lost its credibility--forever.

I love Mondays.... can every one grasp the sarcasm in that statement. I hope so.
is unemployed, and thinks its a good thing :)
just can't get into the Monay state of mind.
Back to work. Trying to get everything cleaned up before the New Year. If you saw my desk, you would understand why I am starting now :)
I have SO happy the Ravens are getting a good start today! I love playoff football.
I don't understand why some people make it so hard for you to be nice to them. I dont understand why I'm worrying about it anyway, they sure aren't.
I don't want to get sick, but I think it's happening anyway :(
Thanksgiving cooking! Fun or stressful, I'll decide later.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
Can't decided if she is going to Jacksonville Saturday or not.

Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious.

Woke up late and didn't get to eat breakfast today -sad- I'm so hungry...
I always make it a rule to let the other fellow fire first.  If a man wants to fight, I argue the question with him and try to show him how foolish it would be.  If he can't be dissuaded, why then the fun begins but I always let him have first crack.  Then when I fire, you see, I have the verdict of self-defence on my side.  I know that he is pretty certain in his hurry, to miss.  I never do.
I want someone to buy me dinner.

Hi Chicago, what's up
was a huge baby when he had his wisdom teeth out a few years ago. Just splayed out on the couch whining constantly. His sister, however, had them out today and treated it like it was nothing!
was PERFECTLY noctural today. My sleep schedule is the worst it has ever been ever! Ugggggggggg...
it's a bird, it's a plane, it's a BIRDPLANE

I finally went grocery shopping. Picked up a small piece of raclette, not knowing what it was, because I wanted something to put on crackers. Turns out it is supposed to be melted over a flame or special grill and then immediately scraped onto some kind of bread. Whyyyy did I get such a difficult cheese? Will just putting it right on a pan or toasting it somehow work? I guess we'll see!
*PROPNAME*... D: *PROPNAME* too?
saw Corialanus at the Globe today. Now where's Dido?

It's surprising how much better *PROPNAME* makes everything
realized today he had no idea what was in eggnog, and looked it up, secretly expecting to find that it was made from something horrible. It is actually made of far more wonderful ingredients than I ever could have imagined!

It's pretty amazing how many hours are required to organize a presentation that is going to last no more than twenty minutes. This would be so much simpler if I could just call Haydn as a witness.
wishes people could just agree on one perfect technique and have done with it!

I just dreamed the mob kidnapped me and was forcing me to host a toothpaste infomercial. The draw for the toothpaste is that it was used by athletes in the Olympics. I kept getting all the names and locations wrong because nobody told me what they were. A burly guy in a suit was getting pretty upset cause we were stopping so much. He was on the roof for some reason. The set looked suspiciously like my backyard. Huh.
Wow, major insomnia attack. Might be a nocturnal weekend.

I wonder if my parents will be able to book my flight before I need to get on it.

Almost the weekend...only a few more short hours...I think we can make it.
Let go Spartans LETS GO!
I am so so excited...Going to the big game...heading home...going to see my dog...I cant sleep!
Gas Station doughnut does not equal paczki, I almot cried a litle
What makes *PROPNAME* so special!!  He is a QUITTER!  Watch out *PROPNAME*...
My mouth always gets me in trouble...
I am dreading glee this week...
I am feeling strangely homesick from thinking about my birthday...I havent had a good one since college...maybe i will just stop trying to make it special
Happy Brithday *PROPNAME*!!  Have a stadium dog for me!
I am in a funk today...I dont know if it is depression, maybe a lack of motivation because of depression.  This process is not for the impatient.
The ""Full House"" home is on the market for 4 mil.  I wonder if being fetured in the show increased its value
Dishwasher repair guy coming tomorrow am, hopefully phone that works being delivered tomorrow as well.  Big day ahead!
So apperently the owners at my school have decided that they want to make things as complicated as possible...enter new and stupidly expensive computer program!
It was good to get out of the house for a little while, and even better to see my girls!
When doing your Christmas cards, take one or more and send it to this address: A Recovering American Soldier c//o *PROPNAME* Army Medical Center 6900 Georgia Avenue NW; Washington, D.C. 20307. If we pass this on, think of how many cards these wonderful special people would get. PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS. (JUST COPY AND PASTE TO YOUR WALL)
wow, nothing like losing to a MAC team to make me cry...I would like to thank pete for ruining the game for me as well...jurk...
What is going on with this bowl game?  I thought that MSU losing 20% of thier players was bad...now texas tech coach scandle?   If you were going to toss a kid in the closet...would you chose the one whose dad is on tv everynight??  Bad call dude!
As much as I love Twlight (Team Taylor!), it is just me, or is it extreeme to be taking kids to see it tonight that are still in elementary school when they have school tomorrow! I guess taking kids period, with the attacks and sexual stuff....
What do *PROPNAME* and the Miami Dolphins have in common? They make 70,000 people stand up and yell ""Jesus Christ""...
I hate to say this, but *PROPNAME* Tonight is actually pretty good...having a hard time chosing between that and *PROPNAME* Lately...
Well, this year has to be better then the last...
""Over the river and to the woods to Boosha's house we go!""
So...I never got the facination with farmville until I built my zoo...totally addicted!  If you have zooworld let me know I will send you a gift
I think one of my gerbils had a stroke...Poor little guy!  After I put the food and water next to her she perked up a little, but she still is moving weird and falling over...
has anyone else realized that *PROPNAME* looks like ""The Situation""?  I am so glad that trashy show is almost over
Back in the ATL, but still just as foggy...luckly work is falling into place without me even doing anything...
*PROPNAME* is going to deal with a ticket...I dont know where his checks are if I need to bail him out!
*PROPNAME* cant wait to dress up and go trick or treating!
Poor little Wolverines...at this rate the NIT is a goal!!  Look at your sad little glum faces...
I am hoping this is allergies and not a cold..
*PROPNAME* noms as predicted...*PROPNAME* saw his furry shadow but the weather man said we are in an el nino...I am on team rodent!
Wow...I should have watched more baseball this year...the twins are playing really well...crap...
So, my tickets for Saturday's Spartan wallop of the *PROPNAME* are in the mail, I should have them tomorrow...Does anyone want to go see U2?
As of today, Facebook staff will be allowed to eat your children and pets. To turn this option off, go to settings, then privacy, then meals. Click the top two boxes to prevent the employees of Facebook from eating your beloved children and pets. Copy this to your status to warn your friends!
Maybe going home grounded me...I feel so much better now!
my facebook looks the same...am I missing something?
feels like Death warmed over...
So my dome light will not go out when I am driving, I actually reasched the problem myself and sent *PROPNAME* out to spray the crap out of my door latches with wd40...I cannot believe I was on a forum looking up car stuff...
Under the cover of shameful darkness, my now former sister became a fan of Michigan football.  Because you did not go there, or any of our family for that matter...that makes you, my former sibling, a WALMART WOLVERINE...yes I went there!  We will see where your loyalties lie when you need a kidney or a piece of my liver...GO NITTANY LIONS!!
HOW DID WE MEET???? Everyone play this game! Copy and paste this phrase on your profile, you will find it amusing to remember how you met and how you know each of your friends! Before you do that answer for me. Thank you and I can't wait to hear from you!!!!!
dang...is this what people feel like when the wings take it all??  Personally when the wings take it all in the cup it makes me smile, but for some reason a suprizing number of people are not red wings fans...
My thanksgiving utopia lasted a whole hour...new record.
Good Job ballers...its all up to the football team now!  GO GREEN, GO WHITE, GO STATE!
DANG IT!!  If you are in Atlanta and need somehere to go for NYE, come to my house, I have food and drink, almost all of my guests are sick or have sick kids!
Errands...
So the guito from Jersey Shore that calls him self ""The Situtation"" is trying to trademerk it now...
So, I tried to sit down and pay my birthday tax today, and I cannot find the paper work...I know I have it here somewhere!
I am glad to say that my parents arrived in Michigan safely...even if thier bags are lost...
Getting ready to come home for Christmas!
NO NO NO *PROPNAME* cannot have a crush on Shoe...
The guy next to me getting a mani//pedi tonight reminded me of someone my dad would golf with...kinda reminded me of home until he started singing along with the radio to Ace of Base, Madonna, and Cher.  It was so hard not to laugh!! So Atlanta!
feeling much better today!  So if the head coach of Texas Tech was fired, is this even going to be a fair game?  Maybe considering many of our players were stupid...
What in God's name happened to cnn.com?
Watered plants, cleaned gerbil cage, did laundry, washed the dishes. Starting on packing  then off to pick up my shoes from the cobbler!
Going to have my emmissions tested, want to just get that out of the way and today seems like a good day for it!  Also running other errands...
I think that *PROPNAME* was embarassed that we were blasting the Glee soundtrack while crusing around with the top down...I can't imagine why
Oh no *PROPNAME* is really sick, I even made him chicken soup yesterday, and he still is running a fever!
Now *PROPNAME* is sick...and realizes what a jerk he was when I was sick
Rest in Peace Uga the Bulldog, the world of college mascots morns you today
*PROPNAME* mixed week old coucous with new coucous, and he cannot understand why I will not eat it...
If you push print once....you only get one copy, so dont look at me like a moron when I bring you the 6 other copys from the 6 other times you pressed print...
I just keep reminding myself...one week until my vacation, one week until my vacation....
Heading back to Atlanta...
here we go again...luckly I work at a school that may close for the chance of snow
Big Game tonight..perfect big ten record on the line...GO GREEN!
I am not ready to get back to real life...
Apple casserole and Herb Pork Loin smells so good!!
Today I am thankful that I am able to be in Michigan with my family.  I am also thankful for my families in Michigan and in Atlanta.  I am most thankful for everyone I love being healthy today.
It makes me sad to see *PROPNAME* all iced over...
What doesnt kill me will make me stronger...
Same old Spartans...
Wow I am really in a funk...I had no idea *PROPNAME* was fired! I knew it was most likely going to be his last season, but I hardly ever miss stuff like that
Snow predicted when I go home!!  I cant wait!
Since when did you become the center of the universe?
Well, I think he has the flu, but it is basically impossible to tell if he has the swine flu
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled �till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn�t before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn�t come from a store. What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.
Ted Nugent is a touch scary, may be an intersting choice for Michigan politics...
Oye, so tired...Sometimes I wish that we could spend more time enjoying and less time preparing this time of year
Apperantly the roads are bad in Atlanta...be careful out there guys!
My mom and I were talking about all the food that reminds me of home last night, now I am a little home sick.  I love this time of year in Michigan!
Well, that wasnt so bad, now I have to wait and see...
Well here goes nothing, getting ready for my first day!
Has anyone else noticed that the dolphin with the helmet on the Miami Dolphins logo looks like it should be riding the short bus?

kitty thinks my leg is fun to climb up.  ow.  But it's hard to be mad when the purpose of the climb is to snuggle with me :)
is kinda glad my front brake is now functional, otherwise I would likely have been squashed by a little yellow car today.
Finally decided on a new name for kitty! Sassafras :)
just got a kitten!!!  Any name ideas for the itty bitty kitty?
from my vet school app, hours I have spent working & volunteering with animals and veterinarians: 3690
marathon on the square at 10pm for happy hour?
sassafras has the sniffles :(

passed out while reading about narcolepsy yesterday...
woke up laughing after thinking in my dream ""Good thing zombies are so slow..."", then a zombie drives by in a car screaming ""NOT IF WE LEARNED HOW TO DRIVE"", and promptly crashes into a wall. :D
Free shipping is my downfall.
Internet downtime, ending procrastination since 1996.
IT'S 4M AND I'VE BEEN LYING IN BED FOR 2 HOURS. RAAAGEE
Mom just found out I'm an atheist and is trying to convert me. Ahahaha
You know in Spiderman where he wakes up, puts on his glasses and realizes he doesn't need them anymore? Yeah, I had that today then I realized I had my contacts on. -.-
I just had a dream that combined The Grudge + Twilight + Harry Potter + Pokemon. Malfoy had unsealed the Grudge demon from within Bella and Bulbasaur and Jigglypuff had to save the world. WTF? That doesn't even make sense.
just got a new chair. I don't know what ""passive lumbar support"" means, but damn does it feel good.
heard someone at home depot ask a worker for ""that thing that makes holes 'n shit."" LOL
Dilemnia: It's 3am and I wanted to blast music through my speakers. >:[
New Year's resolutions... why wait until January? Screw that, December is MY month! I will exercise daily. I will not fall asleep randomly without brushing teeth (eww). I will clean my room weekly. I will not save files with names like 'adsvdsq.' I will finish all tasks by 75% of the deadline. And for motivation, I will move $100 from my checking to my savings account each time I fail! Go go self-improvement!
has been awake for way too long, listening to music way too loudly.
bought so many things during Cyber Monday, he's memorized his credit card number. ://
Spent the last 2 hours sitting in the dark happily listening to music way too loudly at 6am :)
Buckyballs, I want my 6 hours back. >.>
pain is painful.
It's 6am and I can't sleep cause I just finished ordering parts for a new computer. Too excited. I'm nerdy, AND WHAT? D:
Yay! Left my flash drive inside a computer in a PACKED math lab yesterday. Called the office today and asked them to check and it was still there! Now I can go back to sleep; woke up early to call them before anyone found it. Zzzz
Damn sense, always getting in my way.
saw ""IN TRANSIT TO ONTARIO, CA"" on my tracking information and thought ""WHY IS IT GOING TO CANADA?!"" Who knew there was a city named Ontario in California? :x
7:15 chem classss, dieee D: *collapse on floor* zzzzzzzzzzzz
Computer case coming from South LA. Everything else coming from Tennesee. I get to stare at the case and do nothing with it for 4 days. *PROPNAME*, why art thou so cruel? D:
Baking in my room. TT
Came 45minutes late to C++ final, still finished before everyone else. :D
Made the UC App my homepage to stop me from procrastinating. Wait. Why am I here. AHHHH *deletes all bookmarks*
Need a topic for my second UC prompt. Describe me in one word. GO!

I got poked. By *PROPNAME*. Normally I think I'd be much more excited about getting poked, but considering the circumstances (i.e. person) I'm not all that excited. In fact, I'm quite the opposite. Sorry bud but it's still a nub. hahahahaha

Yes, mosquitos in AK are really this big. It is actual size. The size of a grapefruit. Every summer at least three people die from mosquito bites in AK. We need to do something about Global Warming, the mosquitos are planning a revolt! AKns lives depend on cool temperatures! Please think of the Alaskans!!!

Err. Things to not do and people to ignore.
Happy merry Christmas friends.
Why doesn't it say ""what's on your mind"" next to what you write? My mom joke doesn't work without it. It doesn't make sense. How else do you know that your mom is on my mind if it doesn't say ""what's on your mind?""

""yeah, i know! i mean, i'm discovering all this, too---as i say it""  ~ coach mcguirk
[people should just stick to treating eachother the way that they really feel about one another, even if that means giving up whatever they might gain from pretending to like someone they really don't, or having to deal with the temporary awkwardness of admitting that they made a mistake, or changed their mind... or whatever. just a thought.]
guys who claim to like me, present & future:  [...quit telling me what you think i want to hear (especially if you have no intention of backing it up ~CONSISTENTLY~ through your actions)... & just start telling me how it TRULY is, dammit..! if in reality it's not enough, i have a right to know that, & you have no right to claim otherwise.]
...[well i may have screwed up~yet again~but the nice people who keep watching my crash & burn routine (one semester after another) have apparently not lost patience or given up on me quite yet...]     ~i am truly grateful~

if your 2009 was good, i wish you an even better 2010.  if it could have been better, i wish you a great 2010.  i do not, however, wish any of you a happy new decade, since the decade ends at the end of next year

update.  after i feel down the stairs last night, i stood up and proceeded to faint at which point keith came out and started slapping me asking if i was ok.  and in my head, i was responding just fine, but was apparently just mumbling to him.  if i wasn't in pain i would laugh :)  also, good to know that he's there for me when i need him
I heart rockband.  and the beatles.  and my bandmates
am i supposed to be surprised that manny and ortiz were on the 2003 steroids list?  the much more surprising, and much shorter list, would be people playing in the past 10 years who weren't on the list

watching the forgotten . . . i already know i'm going to be pissed off at the end
so, i locked the doors on my truck at kim's, because it's a main road and we'd be busy editing the movie.  however, when i left, i noticed that i left all my windows open.  probably not the safest of security systems

If I wear makeup, I'm fake. If I like to get dressed up, I'm a Tart. If I say what i think, I'm a bitch. If I cry sometimes, I'm a drama queen. If I have guy friends, I'm a slut.

is feeling rather Odinesque today...in a Ragnarok sorta way.
never gives up, never surrenders!
has finally started orientation!  Seems pretty good so far.
had a pretty good day: kayaking, bughouse dodgeball, four-square, and lap tag.  Plus good conversation...
Holy crap this is hilarious: http:////www.standforchristmas.com//pages//home Just read these reviews.  What bigoted morons think like this?  Read the ""Offensive"" ones.  They're the best.
just hit a wall of work.
is in Chicago, yay!  He still misses *PROPNAME*, though...
has too many unknowns to solve his equations, but he'll never stop trying.
is liking the new job so far.  Of course, the kids have yet to arrive...
Anyone wanna see The Fly on Wednesday?  It'll be awesome...
thinks he'll start a Prussia-style diary, and this status update will remind him of his choice until he finally acts upon it.
I'm home, wheee!
Whutta whutta whutta whutta...
Off to the art museum!  Sorry Proposal, I'll work on you later...probably...
Welche bluse magst du lieber, diese oder diese?
Holy mother microfilm is a bitch on the eyes.  Dear 1890, learn to write normal Ms and Ns.  Yours look like Ws and Us.
Hey my Rhode Island friends.  What rocks to do in Providence and what's the best Italian place in the city?
s New Year's Resolution is to negate everyone else's resolutions.
feels like a koala crapped a rainbow in his brain!
is thankful for all his wonderful friends!  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  I wish I could spend it with every one of you.
has the same Spring Break as *PROPNAME*!  If any Cornellians want a super awesome place to visit during their Spring Break, keep Chicago in mind...
wants a cottage cheese and pastrami sandwich on banana bread, even if it severely ruins your reputation!
is my name and I'm here to say, I have the symptoms of an awesome day!
Is back in Chicago!
starts his job tomorrow.  Goodbye Freetimesville, hello Moneytown Station!
27F, feels like 14F....Ah!  It's like being in Ithaca again!  It feels wonderful!  And yes, *PROPNAME*, I am crazy.
is getting better at resisting the urge to Ragequit.
can't help but smile.
HAL is alive once again!  Just in time for 2010, conveniently enough.  Not sure if I'm gonna keep him, cuz he's now missing MS Word, but eh, he has internet.
thinks he's going to make truffles tomorrow...FOR SCIENCE!
And now all I have to do is pack!  Hooray!  One quarter down, two to go!
loves Holst oh so much.
Geez 18th Century Britons, if you love *PROPNAME* the Great so much, why don't you just marry him?
associates Russian classical composers with Christmas, for some reason.  Not just the Nutcracker stuff, either.  It's a bit odd...  Especially since everyone knows Santa lives in Finland, not Russia.
is about to lead an activity on Dating Etiquette...wish me luck.
remembers a time when he was able to easily find classes because the school actually had its shit together and managed to have a central location with all the course descriptions.
Dear Online Dictionary Makers, Let people search the text of the entries, not just the entry words.  Make your dictionaries more like a human brain.  Let me search ""make things the same"" and find words that include those words in their definitions.  That would rock. Love, *PROPNAME*
had a great day off...
reads from his past and mourns the future.
lernas Esperanton!
wonders whether Professor *PROPNAME* would let him write a term paper on fanfictions using theories from the readings...
recently realized there's a large whole in his theoretical structure of life.  It may be a few interations before he has a working solution.
has finished his skeleton drafts, hooray!  Suck it, essays!
The Portuguese pronounce X like SH?  Damnit, is it THEIR fault Romanized Chinese does the same?  I always wondered who to blame for that.
didn't know the chemicals in jalapeno peppers could make your bare skin feel kinda burny.  Huh.
amas lerni novaj lingvoj!
One paper submitted, two to go.
is done!  Hooray!
has a few excellent weekends coming up.  Rock on!
Good morning!  And in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
Well crap.  My computer's software is currently corrupted or something and won't work.  Right before my two Hell Weeks begin.  Wheeee...  Anyone in Chicago have a copy of their Windows XP Professional edition CD I can borrow to reinstall stuff?
wishes he were in Ithaca.  : (
wants to see a version of that *PROPNAME* story ""Gift of the Magi"" where one of the people receives a Bible, only to inform their friend that they sold their soul to Satan to buy them their gift.
leaves for Chicago tomorrow.  Can't wait!  Now if only the magical packing fairy would visit me...
wants to be the very best!  Like no one ever was!
should just become a chef.
had a MUCH better first day of classes than he expected.
loved *PROPNAME*!
I have enemies?  I thought these things always just happened...
is going to nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
just had a great day.
misses Ithacan winters.  Hot weather sucks.  Chicago better be a freezer.
just played Quidditch.  It was awesome.
is sick of starting letters with ""dear.""  My friends are more than dear, I'm using different adjectives from now on.  ""Anti-Establishment *PROPNAME*, how are you?  Signed, *PROPNAME*.""  Screw you, convention!
just got his mind blown.  Apparently *PROPNAME* from Salute Your Shorts, the rich girl, was played by a Chinese-American actress.  I totally never noticed that.  Ever.  Thank you, www.tvtropes.org for once again, showing that I have a terrible memory.
is beginning to miss Chicago and his friends there...
is currently preptastic.
is out getting the paper...before the monsters do, am I right?
wishes a Happy Valentine's Day to all those for whom he cares!  I hope all my friends know how much they mean to me!
is all set for tomorrow!
is thinking tonight of his old college town...
Just did the research and writing for his 12 page term paper in 48 hours.  Revision time!
is going to miss you.
is one iteration closer to his desired solution.
returns to Chicago tomorrow!  Yay!
is one iteration closer to his desired solution!
has finally ended orientation!  That was fast...  Perspectives in Social Science, Historical Methods, and Early Modern England will be my classes this quarter, it seems.
wants to thank the Tabasco company for listing the Scoville Heat Units of its products, and thinks all spicy food makers should follow suit.
finds fiction much more interesting when you imagine the same actors and voice actors to be the same people instead of different characters.  Holy crap, *PROPNAME*'s father is Liquid Snake!  Hey look, Obi-Wan Kenobi is helping Don Quixote liberate the Arabs in WWI!
is ready to begin his day fueled with the power of french toast!  Readings: prepare to be read...
wants to get out of Hyde Park.
had a dream come true!  Last night I dreamt about eating a cinnamon bun, and today I ate a cinnamon bun!
thinks he'll apply to Pigfarts for next year.
RIP HAL 9000...  I think your successor will be named Metal Gear.
started a Prussia-style diary.  Huh...that didn't take long at all.  http:////todayiwassoawesome.wordpress.com//
A bit of Christmas cuteness: http:////www.watchanimeon.com//axis-powers-hetalia-ii-episode-28//
feels weird being in the library during Finals Week as a patron...
is filling his diaries with references to dinosaurs and Bigfoot.  This way, when the world ends and future historians have only my diary for primary sources, they'll think that at least the world was awesome before it ended.  If you care about tricking the future into believing our era was the awesomest ever, I encourage you to do the same.  Together, we can do it!
Is off to see *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*!  And I got an awesome gift in the mail today!  And I learned how to construct a book wheel.  Today is just, like, mega-awesome!
knows that if we tie our houses together, the world will revolve around us!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
finally has apartment pictures up.
wishes all of his Cornellian friends good luck tomorrow!  Enjoy it, it's a wonderful place.
actually danced at a dance.  It was fun.
is glad *PROPNAME* has taken responsibility for what happened.  Don't worry, *PROPNAME*, I'm not mad at you!
Holy Crap!  *PROPNAME*'s has a rewards program that lets you get a free chocolate from the store every month!  How awesome is that?
is looking forward to his new college town.
wants a fat little shetland pony who will complete missions for me...
is sad the weekend is here...  Can't wait for Sunday, 7pm.
just found out Megas XLR is on iTunes!  Life just got a little bit more awesome.
Let's see how honest MY FB friends are. Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me. It can only be one word. No more than one word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. This should be interesting...
s ganache is delicious.
gave up on being a productive member of society when he left engineering, OK Social Sciences?  Just let me write about cool people.  I don't want to think about how my topic benefits anyone.
is enjoying Chicago immensely.  If only time were passing a little more slowly.
First day of classes for a new quarter!  I hope no suddenly loud girls give me coronary thrombosis like last quarter...
is going to a research reactor tomorrow, yay!
grew bolder day by day.
danced again last night.  This is starting to become a pattern...
You can ask me one question (Send it to my inbox). Any question- anything. No matter how awkward it can be I'll answer it honestly, no catch. But, I dare you to put this as your status and see what people ask you.  (I can't resist dares...)
wants to be asleep and isn't.  Damn you, not-terrible work ethic!
Is looking forward to the weekend.
wishes everyone a happy first day of classes yayyyyyyy!
wishes he were in Ithaca.  They get snow...
has the most melodramatic sister in the world...
Holy crap!  Hiero II of Syracuse was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus!  I never knew that!  Hiero has the official title of Awesomest Friendhaver in the Ancient World now, so far as I'm concerned.  Pyrrhus and Archimedes, at least!  Go Hiero!  You're MY hero!
Come on Massachusetts!  You guys are supposed to be New English!  What happened?
PONY!
dreads his mortality as he walks the empty aisles of a library, admiring the volumes, yet knowing his life will never last long enough for him to enjoy them all.
gazed upon the face of the Savior of the Monkeys and wept from the beauty of the sight.
doesn't want to say goodbye next week.  : (
is impressed that the ads on the side of FB are getting relevant without being offensively so...finally.  I've got an ad for a book I like, a band I like, and a movie by an animator I like.  Yay!
has to start planning his thesis...
is in love with a girl named *PROPNAME*...  Damn that stuff is delicious.

hates the person downstairs. I'm trying to work up here. I don't need you singing a vocalese while you're gargling at the sink. I mean really...
Who wants free stuff? The more I get rid of, the less I have to move. Dresser? Coat Rack? Shelves? Desk? Bathroom Stereo? Really people, you're doing me a favor by just taking it.

Let's see... we've had typhoons in pacific asia, and now heavy flooding in the UK, bushfires in Australia, Landslides in Turkey, Volcano Eruption in Colombia, New mutation of H1N1 that's resistant to tamiflu, and a whole lot of violent human related killings, while here in Singapore we complain about water reaching our ankles...

A break from the norm in the wake of this storm is the strange sound of silence as I wait to be born

There is no emotion; there is peace.  There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.  There is no passion; there is serenity.  There is no death; there is the Force.
I love chaos, for most are consumed by it, blind to its hidden beauty, allowing me excludibility to revel at its magnificence.

I have got loads of naturally white hair, am easily fatigued, suffer from the occasional backache, and am now growing a nice round tummy, apparently. I'm getting too old for this...
Well, according to my parents, when I was like 6, everytime my sister tried to call me 'abang', I'd shout at her and say, ""Brother!! Not abang!!"" At least now I know why I never got anywhere with malay >.>

Just experienced water rationing. It was fun. It's what happens when construction workers screw up and break the water pipe for your block... LOL (no water the whole day today and tomorrow) :o
Weak hearts faint, When troubles rises. Brave hearts soars, Steals all the prizes. False heart, it shrinks small in peace. And finds in fear, no sucrease.
He who has not found something which he would die for has no right to live.
Believes that life is like the open sea, and truth is the wind in our sails. (no wonder I'm not moving)
Trust should only be given to those who truly understand its value.
The world is so desperate nowadays that the promise for peace can win a man a Nobel Prize. Let's hope that he keeps his word.
I have to run, run to the moment that set me free. I need to know why I hear the sound... the sound of my dream -
Thanks to some random person in my class having H1N1, my exams have been postponed for like... A ENTIRE WEEK!!! So now... Back to Warcraft... and imma panic later XD
The americans have forgotten that they were once terrorists to the british ~

Reflecting upon an entire week of school break: - Good News - I cleaned my room! - Bad News   - That was about the only beneficial thing I did the entire week..... Conclusion: I'm sooooo screwed..... >_>
After 3 hours of online reading and research, I have diagnosed myself to have a type of Red-Green colour deficiency, under Anomalous Trichomy, called Deuteranomaly.  LIFE SUCKS! ...
had a - has a fever. Got stuck in a jam at orchard road. After the jam, bus broke down. While waiting at a new bus stop, two busses drove by without stopping. Ended up taking four hours to get home. God is Evil.
Is sooo screwed for his promos..... Good Bye JC Life... ~.~
There was a staff meeting earlier today... When everyone was gathered, attention focused on the manager, I heard the Godfather soundtrack start to play over the speakers... just before the manager started speaking... Coincidence? I THINK NOT! >.>

ITS OVER 9000!!!@#$%^&!! :D
When you start debating to yourself on the mechanisms of magic, you also subconciously debate as to the strength of your hold on reality. Conclusion: Fantasy is addictive. O,O
Me, myself, and my computer. Deja vu
Realised that he is actually a Virgo... lol
needs to change...
Women speak because they wish to speak, whereas a man speaks only when driven to speech by something outside himself -- like, for instance, when he can't find any clean socks...
Quote of the day: ""Sex is a weapon the girls use to defeat us!"" - Random Primary school boys who were sitting behind me on a bus... lol
No sense makes nonsense, but nonsense makes sense. So what then is nonsense, in a world without sense? O.o

""I believe it all is coming to an end. Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend"". Ever feel like a five-year-old who is content to cover his//her eyes to feel safe and secure? If I can't see you, you can't see me..lol..I want us all to stop ignoring the important things. They won't go away if you ignore them. I promise.
""I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won. No one can take away the blood that covers over my bones. Without the blood of perfect life I know I'm nothing at all.""
What makes people happy? Apparently we really suck at knowing what makes us happy. Its a measurable, replicable scientific fact. I dunno why that strikes me funny. lol. Lord, teach us to be joyful in you.
thinks that it is impossible to be TOO heavenly minded. Watch. Those who are ""too heavenly minded"" will do the greatest good here.
will gladly boast in his weaknesses. When I am weak, then He is strong. Your might, oh Lord is endless. Please cover over me. Please cover over your beloved..Lest we  all fall in overwhelming shame under the weight of our imperfections.
we're goin down down in an earlier round...a loaded god complex is pointed right at us. Lord, please be God here. Please bless our hearts of love
Thank you, Lord, for today :) The day that three  years ago you let me start to make mine the most amazing woman ever! :) I love you *PROPNAME* :)
I love *PROPNAME* 0:)
says happy fathers day! In honor of my heavenly Father, who's never forsaken me or let me down. May you ever be praised, Dad :)
is with his darling...oh what simple things many take for granted. Thank you Lord for your gift of life. Thank you Lord for *PROPNAME* :)
As long as I'm alive, I'd die for you. Thank You Lord for your love and Your awakening it within me.
hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
""We are the sons of holy wrath,A shining light in the darkThe ones who walk amongst despair,No sign of fear in our hearts""
Lord please bless our time together. Its so difficult to go so long without being with the treasure You have graced my life with. I pray that you bring her to me safely and that I pursue her well.
neoplatonic thinking postulates ""the one"" is infinite and gives rise, eventually, to this world of 'becoming"". Lord you were, are, and forever will be. My one. May I draw all life and thought from Your essential creativity. May I be made to be like Your form. Good.
""Wilt thou change this world... Or wilt thou change thyself?""...can't i do both?
I like where we are. here :)...except...where's my julie?????? :(((. I don't like where we are anymore...
is. Learning to be at peace and just be is harder than it should be ;). Lord you are. You just ARE. Teach me to be like you. Teach me to be.
This will probably take a good long while to get used to :) I think I'm still in shock. Haha. I have a fiance. Wow. And not just any fiance; I am pursuing the pearl of great value :D
Jesus. You're the lover of my soul. Jesus. I will never let you go. You've taken me from the mirey place; set my feet upon the rock, and now I know...
stop regarding men. What account is he? --isaiah 2:22.. We are nothing more than a nose-full of breath. Oh man, how frail are you? Why do you expect regard? Why do I?
Gimme your eyes for just one second. Gimme your eyes so I can see. Everything that I keep missin, gimme your love for humanity. Gimme your arms for the broken-hearted, the ones that are far beyond my reach...
is excited her :D For serious, that's all i can think about
thinks its a kind of non-funny cosmic joke that if he really ever does defeat pride...he will find himself proud of his humility. :P Good call *PROPNAME*
is examining himself. 2 Cor 13:5. Testing himself to see if he is in the faith. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose. Phillipians 2:12-13
Dude, its freaking snowing!!!!! Yay!!!! Let's play in it!
I don't know how it all works. I don't know why. I don't know how. I just am who you made me. I have what you gave me. Let me be yours. Please take all I have as yours. Let me be holy and of you. I desire for my life to boil your vapor from my skin forever. Burn everlasting flame. Flinted face, calloused knuckles, and grinding teeth...my best. That's what you got.
wonders at the absolute absurdity of man's hatred...Christ summed up all the goodness we are capable of in two commands...none of us even follows just one of them.
Lord, be my portion. Christ trusted you to provide all the help He ever needed. Let me do the same.
When paul says ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me""...I think, ""I can do nothing without You, dear Jesus, who strengthens me""
Whatever good I do comes not from me. Goodness is of God, and through me He chooses to make His power known. Thank You, Lord.
is being conformed to the image of Christ. Do you want to be like Jesus? Then you must learn something...you must learn how to love someone who does not meet the conditions. It's not easy, but it's not impossible.
is anxiously attached. I don't know how to ask for help. And I don't know how to accept it. ---i'll drag my own intestines back to dyer, thank you very much.
""All these weirdos, and me getting a little better every day...I had never known...that there might be a place for people like us""--*PROPNAME*
An awakening? Lord awaken the sleeper. Let our eyes burst open to the rising light of Your Spirit. Let Your mercy wash us and let Your holiness mold us into the image of Your Son. Break us with fire and build us from the ashes. Come to life you dry, old b
Lord let your glory fall as on that ancient day. Let it fall on both of them. Let your grace be made known eternally and mightily.
loves being broken. It means I fought hard and didn't give up. I'll wrestle with you, oh God of Jacob, and I won't let go.
God is faithful to His word and to those to whom He has given it
""why art thou cast down oh my soul?"" Oh yeah, because my darling isn't here. Lord, this is a high calling indeed.
is excited to see her :D For serious, that's all i can think about
""I believe the world is burning to the ground. Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out""--How far have we come, Lord? Let us make the most of the time we do have here. We waste TOO much time on so many things that don't matter. Its not worth it. Really.
""Ever since the day I was born i've been deciding the end..."" let your light guide my way, oh Lord. You are the great shepherd.
6am on a saturday is far to early to drag one's self out of bed...ugh, God thank you for this morning..even though I'd like to be sleeping it away...It really is a beautiful morning :)
let me be one who leans on his staff in the last days...broken and weak, and in that weakness let me lift my hands in honor and praise to He who saved me by His own merit. Thank You dear Father who makes His goodness known in me. May You be glorified.
life never seems to stop changing. Its crazy to think college is almost over. Wow. Lord, please guide the steps of my life as it is so formless yet traced before me.
Dude, I'm freaking engaged! To the sweetest angel of a fiance ever! Thank you Lord for your love through this woman :D
is praying hard to be just one who scatters seed on the earth.
""knowledge without repentance will be but a torch to light your way to hell""
""No demanding without understanding"" --*PROPNAME*
Screw you AXLE
Happy Valentine's day everybody! And especially   to my sweet fiancee (with two ""e's""), *PROPNAME* , who makes this day very very  special  for me! Hey ya'll don't take for granted that you can hold the  one you  love in your arms. I'd give both of my arms just to see my love  right  now.
is a deer panting for your living water. I thirst for the living God and in my thirst I need your rest. Precious Lord, carry me for even at my strongest I lack the strength to stand on my own. Amen
Because you, oh Lord, are He who created all things, sustains all things, and knows all things. All things came from you, are of you, and will return unto your breast from whence they came. Blessing and honor and glory to you, oh Father. This is the song of my spirit...praising its origin. You. My God.
is not with his darling anymore :( sad day(s)...Lord, be my sustanence as you always are. Especially now that much of my joy is 700 miles away from me. I love you *PROPNAME*, and I miss you!
A prospering tree does not eat it's own fruit. A prospering tree produces fruit that others might eat.
Does it really take cancer or death to bring us to have a heart for our family? Really? Lord, at this rate, it'll take You coming on the clouds, blowing our minds and shaking us from our complacent lives...complacent in the daily grind. Complacent in our justifiable self-pity. Complacent in our self-centeredness. It'll take You to show us how wrong we all are.
""I gotta feelin. Woohoo...that tonight's gonna be a good night"" :) I like it when prayer's answered sweetly and things work out well. Thanks God :)
Let me know you more deeply and truely, oh Lord. There are none who know you completely, and so I pray that YOU show me. Your ways are perfect and I want my life to sing your praise. Let me walk with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
I can't remember when the earth turned slowly...so i'll just wait here with the lights turned out again. I lost my place, but I can't stop this story. I'll find my way, but til then I'm only...spinning
So much to say. So much to do. So much to be. So little time. 24 hours is already to small an amount of time. Its hard to be without you.
Is going completely insane with anticipation :) T-minus 24 hours til *PROPNAME*'s arrival in Nashville!
""hope in a wasteland of faith; stone figures hewn down; blood flowing through ancient sewers""
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Holy! Holy! Are you Lord God almighty! Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb that was slain! Unto you be all glory and honor and praise! May my life bring glory to your name :)
is a tax collector who standing afar off would not even raise his eyes to heaven. I pray, ""God, be merciful to me, a sinner.""
is waiting on the Lord this morning
To understand how ridiculously excited I am to see my fiance, you must first win the lottery, do somersaults, run a hundred miles effortlessly, wake up to birds chirping, eat a super-yummy meal, and be addicted to oxygen...then you might get close to scratching the surface. Maybe
has walked a thousand miles with grace so far. I could walk like this forever...Jesus how can you be so good to me?? May you be praised in every step I take. Always
Truly knows so little. Thank You, Oh Lord, that You are wise and You are mighty. Thank You, Lord, that Your grace knows no limits or bounds. I pray You're will be done here on earth as it is in heaven and that we give You glory with our lives.
Though the air is cold outside, I pray You warm our hearts with Your love.
*PROPNAME*. The spice of life. Apparently its one of my signature strengths :). How can I help make your life more adventurous today? Thank you, Lord, for making me salt and light.
Everlasting, Eternal One, Zealous Conqueror, Creator, Sustainer, Almighty...how can I appeal to your highest pleasure. What can I bring to you that you do not already have? Vanity. Even to define my mission as one to bring you glory is utter foolishness. What can I lift up with these dirty hands? What can I sing with defiled lips?
